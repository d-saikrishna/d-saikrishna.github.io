quote:remarks:author
But man’s duty is to try and endeavour; success depends upon chance and environments:Singh made this statement explaining his journey towards atheism. There were testing times at which Singh was tempted to use little bit of myticism to make his disbeleif in god more poetic. Akin to modern Atheists who say that they are spiritual. But Singh termed this as intoxication. He wanted to be a realist and overcame the temptation to rely on mysticism. Singh agrees that he was not successful always. But man’s duty is to try; success depends upon chance and envrionments. :Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Criticism and independent thinking are two indispensable qualities of a revolutionary:Singh spoke of the mentality of the masses that oppose one to be a sceptic. The mentality that relies on faith. He advocated for reason. He advocated criticism and independent thinking for human progress and not relying on faith.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Beleif softens the hardships even can make them pleasant:Singh recalled his experience in the jail when a couple of well meaning police-men asked him to pray. He agreed that beleif in god and religion allows one to deal with hardships better. One can even give pleasant meanings to the hardships by taking recourse to religion. Nevertheless  Singh refused to pray. He was a stauch realist.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
A short life of struggle with no maginificient end shall in itself be the reward:Singh said that religious people do good activities with selfish motives – for heavens or to be reborn as Kings. Singh fought for freedom not expecting any after-life reward. He knew that life or soul would end the moment he get hanged. He believed that if more people work for the mankind for the mere reward in it and not for any after life rewards  that would initiate the era of liberty.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Non-Violence as a policy is indispensable for all mass movements:Singh’s thoughts about violence changed a lot as he grew. When young he was an active advocator of violence against the British Empire. However as he read more and gained experience in the freedom struggle his thoughts changed. He believed that force is justifiable only in times of terrible necessity. And to organise mass movements non-violence is indispensable:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence:Used in the context of pseudo-science. Whenever anyone comes up with an extraordinary claimthe onus is on them to also bring extraordinary evidence to prove that claim.:Carl Sagan
Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both:Sagan spoke about exploring the Cosmos here. Without imaginationone cannot think further and step into unchartered territories. Skepticism helps in distinguishing facts from fancy. It tests our imagination.:Carl Sagan – Cosmos
Parents are defined by their mistakes:This line was a slap on my face. I often judged my parents for their mistakes. I ignored all other facets of life in which they were great. This line made me practice gratitude for my parents. I struggle to express my love to themso hope they read this!:Fredrik Backman – Anxious People
There was an unexpected freedom in finding out that one wasn’t as important as one had always assumed:There is freedom in insignificance. I used to stress a lot thinking that I’m extremely important. But I was replaced very easily. I felt bad initally but I realised that this insignificance gave me immense freedom. I stress less now. And I read astronomy often to remember my insignificance.:Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni – Palace of Illusions
There is only one sin. That is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft.:As I reflect backall terrible things that I have done are variations of thefts. Stealed people’s peace of mindtime etc. Stealing money now appears a less intense variant of theft.:Khaled Hosseini – Kite Runner
Stories are equipment for living:The reason why I write and act. We humans evolved through stories. They are part of us. No matter what you doyou are always looking for stories. Great stories become civilisational values. They shape culture. And the greatest good you can do for humanity is to tell a good story. Either through your lifeworkwritings or movies!:Kenneth Burke
Love cuts two ways – we possess it when we give it freedombut destory it with possessiveness:I learnt it the hard way. There is a thin line between love and obsession. And your love towards someone can easily become obsession. The moment it becomes obsessionyou strangulate the other person and destroy love. If you cannot trust the other person with freedomdon’t live in a denial that you love them.:Robert Mckee – Story
Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderersand we are wanderers still:I have no clue about my career and life. There are so many things I like and want to pursue seriously. For years I have struggled incorporating these interests in my life. I felt guilty doing the exploration. HoweverI am slowly coming to terms with my nature. If exploration is what I wantI will do that. A little responsibly. :Carl Sagan – Cosmos
He’d really done something to be proud of now – no one could say he was just a famous name any more:Harry Potter was always given respect because of his parents. But when he won the Quidditch match for Gryffindorhe got a genuine applause. The kind of validation one gets for their true talent and effort is beautiful.:J.K Rowling – Harry Potter and the philosopher’s stone
My childlet me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.:This is one of the best relationship advise I’ve come across. Mr Bennet is concerned of his daughter Elizabeth’s choice of husband – Mr.Darcy. He asked her to think twice and not be part of a marriage in which she cannot respect her partner. He got convinced only after listening to Elizabeth’s new found respect for Mr Darcy. :Jane Austen – Pride and Prejudice
There is little correlation between circumstance’s of people’s lives and how happy they are:Dr Kurien wrote to his grandson about living a good life. He suggested that something would always go wrong in life and one cannot rely their happiness on circumstances. I feel Happiness has to be a default state. There is no pursuit of it. Tell yourselves that you are happy no matter what the circumstances are. No ifs and buts.:Dr Verghese Kurien in his letter to his grandson
We fought for two things — Freedom and Independence. We attained Independence.:Independence is freedom from external political control. We won that freedom from British in 1947. But there are many more freedoms to be won. That’s the journey ahead for us.:Captain BhauToofan Sena – The Last Heroes
The slingshot was my weapon. The cellphone and the laptop are yours. :Mallu Swarajywam is a freedom fighter who fought against the Razakars.

She appealed to the youth to continue freedom struggle with the weapons they possess.:Mallu Swarajyam
I was like a bird caught in a snare. Onlythe wires of this snare were made of curiosity and a disobedient heart.:This was Draupadi’s inner monologue in the book. Often our curiosities are wild and are against the conventions. That’s when they become snares. But one cannot avoid them as wellfor curiosity is what makes us human. How do you deal with a disobedient heart?:Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni – Palace of Illusions
That’s the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone does too.:Did you also come across anyone who speaks non-sense and then say they didn’t mean it? If yesyou would get this line.:Khaled Hosseini – Kite Runner
It is the struggle to repeat and perpetuate pleasure which turns it into pain:Krishnamurthy delineated between joy and pleasure. Joy is when you can enjoy any experience without expecting permanence or repetition of the experience. The moment you expect repetitionfear and pain creep in. You might secure pleasures by becoming a control freakbut you will not get joy from the experiences any more.:Jiddu Krishnamurthy – Freedom from the known
If you hurt other people because they have expectations of youthat’s their problem. If they have an agreement with youthat’s your problem.:I was told that I was being a people pleaser. It was because I was hesitant to hurt others. But you cannot be assertive and not be people pleaser if you cannot hurt others. This line helped me in this context. I’ll only please the agreements I makenot the expectations you have of me.:The Almanack of Naval Ravikant
If you can’t decidethe answer is NO:Any question in lifeframe it in a way such that it elicits an Yes/No answer. And if you cannot say Yessay No. There are immense opportunities that are awaiting for your Yes. :The Almanack of Naval Ravikant
Ultimatelythe problems are not scientific or technicalbut ethical and political:Every problem you can think of will eventually be solved. Science and technology will solve it. But the real problems are ethical and political. How do we use AI or Gene Editing? Are we okay choosing the color of our babies? These are the questions the future will debate about.:Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
Freedompressed to its ultimatenegates itself.:One of the sources of unfreedom is paralysing effect of overchoice. I faced this from choosing clothes to careers. You are free to wear anythingbut too many options confuse you. Hence you have to make a super-decision to deal with this paralysis. Like Mark Zuckerberg only wearing grey t shirt.:Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
Terrorism may not topple regimesbut it removes doubts.:Toffler spoke about Terrorism in the widest sense – even including terror of an authoritarian parent. Violence is basically employed because we are unable to deal with the complexity of choice. To democratically make a decision is to deal with multiple perspectiveswhich could to doubting your own opinions as well. So people with powerof positiongun or stateexert that power to end the debate so that they need not live in doubt any more. :Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
To introduce an anti-malarial vaccine without birth control is to tear a culture apart:Think deeplyyou’ll understand Systems Thinking with this quote.:Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
As overchoice deepensthe person lacking clear grasp of his own values is progressively crippled.:Your values are super-decisions you make that simplify your life. When faced with the paralyzing effect of overchoicevalues act as a filter. I value minimalism that helps me filter out a lot of choices available as I shop for anything.:Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
All great men are play actors fo their own ideal.:Every great person should start as an imposter. You set an ambitious goal which your current self cannot achieve at the moment. You become an imposter and be an actor believing that you can do it. That’s the only way to push boundaries and be on the path to greatness.:Friedrich Nietzsche – Beyond Good and Evil
The maturity of man—that meansto have reacquired the seriousness that one had as a child at play.:A child at play is nothing but great focus and will to win the game. They are full of purpose. It is the adults that are playing their games with least intent and will. Maturity is to find intentionpurpose and will back.:Friedrich Nietzsche – Beyond Good and Evil

The desire can be fulfilled by various other things and I need not be desperate about one particular thing.:Friedrich Nietzsche – Beyond Good and Evil
Desire (kama) is the force that creates the world; Destiny (karma) is the counter-force that limits satisfaction of desires:We are born with certain destiniesprivileges or oppressionsthat determine our social roles. The destiny of a water drop on a hill is to reach the valley due to gravity. But desire can change destiny. If you desire to stop the movement of the water dropyou can change its destiny by building a dam. But can you always change your destinies? Can we bring harmony between our desires and destinies?:Devdutt Pattanaik – my Hanuman Chalisa
We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking:Habits form even before we are conscious of them. This is not just about regular habits. People marry and make living with the partner a habit even before thinking if that’s the best decision for them. Many such habits that stops one from living a well examined life.:Albert Camus – Myth of Sisyphus
I'm filled with a desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither:A precise definition of absurdism. You are screaming at the world for answers but the world remains silent. We have to live in this absurd world. And it’s not something to despair. There is freedom in it. Absurd freedom.:Albert Camus – Myth of Sisyphus
Become so very free that your whole existence is an act of rebellion:The ultimate freedom Camus speaks about is the freedom from finding meaning of life. Our desperation to find meaning in life is often exploited. Be free of it and you will be the absurd hero.:Albert Camus – Myth of Sisyphus

Existence precedes Essence:When you want to make a knifeyou first decide on its essence. It should be sharplong etc. Basicallyyou design it first and then make it. For the knifeessence precedes its existence. If you believe that you are also designed by the God for a particular functionyou can believe the same that is applicable for the knife. But many terrorists also believe the same. In Existentialismwe believe the opposite. That there is no design. We exist first and then design our lives ourselves – with freedom.:Jean Paul Sartre
When we say that man is responsible for himselfwe do not mean that he is responsible only for his own individualitybut that he is responsible for all men.:Sartre says that humans are free and they should freely do things of his interest with ‘responsibility’. And he defines this responsibility in a very wide sense - by applying the logic of universality. i.e.if you are not happy if every one does the same action that you doyour action is an irresponsible action. Sartre says that “man is a legislator of the mankind” through his actions. If you cheat in an examthen you are basically committing that cheating is responsible and universal. There is some nuance to itbut this is itmore or less.:Jean Paul Sartre
Man is nothing other than his own project. He exists only to the extent that he realizes himselftherefore he is nothing more than the sum of his actionsnothing more than his life:Sartre made this statement in the context of excuses we generally give for not doing what we want to do. We are what we do - not what we think we can do. There are many aspiring writer friends of mine who hesitate to write. Excuses abound. They think there is potential in thembut it remains there - as potential. See the focus on verbs instead of nouns. Sartre says to focus on action and action alone. Let others give you nouns based on your actions.:Jean Paul Sartre
For existentialists there is no potential for love other than that which is manifested in loving:Sartre made this statement in the context of excuses we generally give for not doing what we want to do. We are what we do - not what we think we can do. There are many aspiring writer friends of mine who hesitate to write. Excuses abound. They think there is potential in thembut it remains there - as potential. See the focus on verbs instead of nouns. Sartre says to focus on action and action alone. Let others give you nouns based on your actions.:Jean Paul Sartre
"You say there is no love, my love, Unless it lasts for aye! Oh, folly, there are interludes, Better than the play.:I believe we can all accept love better if we stop obsessing that it has to stay forever.

"His love for her affected her own self-esteem. She liked herself better because of him:This is one of the finest definitions of love I've come across. I was surprised that this came from a Scientist, Carl Sagan. Love should bring out the best in people.:Carl Sagan – Contact"
"She began to understand why lovers talk baby talk to one another. There was no other socially acceptable circumstance in which the children inside her were permitted to come out.:This paragraph is very relatable for me.

"I do not seek a life without mistakes, only a life worth living::Meghana Yerabati – Soft bones"
"In midst all the noises out there to distract you, if there is one thing you must remember is “build”. :Create stories, solutions, products, teams etc. A mindful life is lived in the process of creation than consumption.:Rushab Mehta (Frappe)"
"If your only tool is hammer, all your problems will be nails:I do this often. No matter what the problem is, I often try to hit it with code or stats. Police hit every problem with their lathis. Capitalists hit every problem with their money. Communists hit every problem with their class struggle theory. Etc. This can be solved by increasing the number of tools at hand. Diversity in teams help in that regard. Diversity is often seen only as a moral imperative. But it is practical as well.:Mark Twain"
"Peter, before you can do things for people, you must be the kind of man who can get things done:One of my mentors told me that I can do the greatest good to humanity by doing what I can do well in the best possible manner. Not by chasing 'impact'. It stayed with me and has influenced my career decisions.:Fountainhead – Ayn Rand"
Civilization is the process of setting man free from men:Laws of the mob governed lives of individual for larger part of the history. Progress is to protect individuals from these mobs.:Fountainhead – Ayn Rand
"Self-sacrifice? But it is precisely the self that cannot and must not be sacrificed:When I entered the development sector, I told myself that self sacrifice is a virtue. That I'm here to do that.

I am utterly selfish that 'I' want to solve them.:Fountainhead – Ayn Rand"
