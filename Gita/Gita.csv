quote:remarks:author
But man’s duty is to try and endeavour; success depends upon chance and environments:Singh made this statement explaining his journey towards atheism. There were testing times at which Singh was tempted to use little bit of myticism to make his disbeleif in god more poetic. Akin to modern Atheists who say that they are spiritual. But Singh termed this as intoxication. He wanted to be a realist and overcame the temptation to rely on mysticism. Singh agrees that he was not successful always. But man’s duty is to try; success depends upon chance and envrionments. :Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Criticism and independent thinking are two indispensable qualities of a revolutionary:Singh spoke of the mentality of the masses that oppose one to be a sceptic. The mentality that relies on faith. He advocated for reason. He advocated criticism and independent thinking for human progress and not relying on faith.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Beleif softens the hardships even can make them pleasant:Singh recalled his experience in the jail when a couple of well meaning police-men asked him to pray. He agreed that beleif in god and religion allows one to deal with hardships better. One can even give pleasant meanings to the hardships by taking recourse to religion. Nevertheless  Singh refused to pray. He was a stauch realist.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
A short life of struggle with no maginificient end shall in itself be the reward:Singh said that religious people do good activities with selfish motives – for heavens or to be reborn as Kings. Singh fought for freedom not expecting any after-life reward. He knew that life or soul would end the moment he get hanged. He believed that if more people work for the mankind for the mere reward in it and not for any after life rewards  that would initiate the era of liberty.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Non-Violence as a policy is indispensable for all mass movements:Singh’s thoughts about violence changed a lot as he grew. When young he was an active advocator of violence against the British Empire. However as he read more and gained experience in the freedom struggle his thoughts changed. He believed that force is justifiable only in times of terrible necessity. And to organise mass movements non-violence is indispensable:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence:Used in the context of pseudo-science. Whenever anyone comes up with an extraordinary claim, the onus is on them to also bring extraordinary evidence to prove that claim.:Carl Sagan
Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both:Sagan spoke about exploring the Cosmos here. Without imagination, one cannot think further and step into unchartered territories. Skepticism helps in distinguishing facts from fancy. It tests our imagination.:Carl Sagan – Cosmos
Parents are defined by their mistakes:This line was a slap on my face. I often judged my parents for their mistakes. I ignored all other facets of life in which they were great. This line made me practice gratitude for my parents. I struggle to express my love to them, so hope they read this!:Fredrik Backman – Anxious People
There was an unexpected freedom in finding out that one wasn’t as important as one had always assumed:There is freedom in insignificance. I used to stress a lot thinking that I’m extremely important. But I was replaced very easily. I felt bad initally but I realised that this insignificance gave me immense freedom. I stress less now. And I read astronomy often to remember my insignificance.:Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni – Palace of Illusions
There is only one sin. That is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft.:As I reflect back, all terrible things that I have done are variations of thefts. Stealed people’s peace of mind, time etc. Stealing money now appears a less intense variant of theft.:Khaled Hosseini – Kite Runner
Stories are equipment for living:The reason why I write and act. We humans evolved through stories. They are part of us. No matter what you do, you are always looking for stories. Great stories become civilisational values. They shape culture. And the greatest good you can do for humanity is to tell a good story. Either through your life, work, writings or movies!:Kenneth Burke
Love cuts two ways – we possess it when we give it freedom, but destory it with possessiveness:I learnt it the hard way. There is a thin line between love and obsession. And your love towards someone can easily become obsession. The moment it becomes obsession, you strangulate the other person and destroy love. If you cannot trust the other person with freedom, don’t live in a denial that you love them.:Robert Mckee – Story
Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still:I have no clue about my career and life. There are so many things I like and want to pursue seriously. For years I have struggled incorporating these interests in my life. I felt guilty doing the exploration. However, I am slowly coming to terms with my nature. If exploration is what I want, I will do that. A little responsibly. :Carl Sagan – Cosmos
He’d really done something to be proud of now – no one could say he was just a famous name any more:Harry Potter was always given respect because of his parents. But when he won the Quidditch match for Gryffindor, he got a genuine applause. The kind of validation one gets for their true talent and effort is beautiful.:J.K Rowling – Harry Potter and the philosopher’s stone
My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.:This is one of the best relationship advise I’ve come across. Mr Bennet is concerned of his daughter Elizabeth’s choice of husband – Mr.Darcy. He asked her to think twice and not be part of a marriage in which she cannot respect her partner. He got convinced only after listening to Elizabeth’s new found respect for Mr Darcy. :Jane Austen – Pride and Prejudice
There is little correlation between circumstance’s of people’s lives and how happy they are:Dr Kurien wrote to his grandson about living a good life. He suggested that something would always go wrong in life and one cannot rely their happiness on circumstances. I feel Happiness has to be a default state. There is no pursuit of it. Tell yourselves that you are happy no matter what the circumstances are. No ifs and buts.:Dr Verghese Kurien in his letter to his grandson
We fought for two things — Freedom and Independence. We attained Independence.:Independence is freedom from external political control. We won that freedom from British in 1947. But there are many more freedoms to be won. That’s the journey ahead for us.:Captain Bhau, Toofan Sena – The Last Heroes
The slingshot was my weapon. The cellphone and the laptop are yours. :Mallu Swarajywam is a freedom fighter who fought against the Razakars. She is upset that the youth today has stopped fighting for freedoms. She was barely educated formally, but that did not stop her. She appealed to the youth to continue freedom struggle with the weapons they possess.:Mallu Swarajyam
I was like a bird caught in a snare. Only, the wires of this snare were made of curiosity and a disobedient heart.:This was Draupadi’s inner monologue in the book. Often our curiosities are wild and are against the conventions. That’s when they become snares. But one cannot avoid them as well, for curiosity is what makes us human. How do you deal with a disobedient heart?:Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni – Palace of Illusions
That’s the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone does too.:Did you also come across anyone who speaks non-sense and then say they didn’t mean it? If yes, you would get this line.:Khaled Hosseini – Kite Runner
It is the struggle to repeat and perpetuate pleasure which turns it into pain:Krishnamurthy delineated between joy and pleasure. Joy is when you can enjoy any experience without expecting permanence or repetition of the experience. The moment you expect repetition, fear and pain creep in. You might secure pleasures by becoming a control freak, but you will not get joy from the experiences any more.:Jiddu Krishnamurthy – Freedom from the known
If you hurt other people because they have expectations of you, that’s their problem. If they have an agreement with you, that’s your problem.:I was told that I was being a people pleaser. It was because I was hesitant to hurt others. But you cannot be assertive and not be people pleaser if you cannot hurt others. This line helped me in this context. I’ll only please the agreements I make, not the expectations you have of me.:The Almanack of Naval Ravikant
If you can’t decide, the answer is NO:Any question in life, frame it in a way such that it elicits an Yes/No answer. And if you cannot say Yes, say No. There are immense opportunities that are awaiting for your Yes. :The Almanack of Naval Ravikant
Ultimately, the problems are not scientific or technical, but ethical and political:Every problem you can think of will eventually be solved. Science and technology will solve it. But the real problems are ethical and political. How do we use AI or Gene Editing? Are we okay choosing the color of our babies? These are the questions the future will debate about.:Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
Freedom, pressed to its ultimate, negates itself.:One of the sources of unfreedom is paralysing effect of overchoice. I faced this from choosing clothes to careers. You are free to wear anything, but too many options confuse you. Hence you have to make a super-decision to deal with this paralysis. Like Mark Zuckerberg only wearing grey t shirt.:Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
Terrorism may not topple regimes, but it removes doubts.:Toffler spoke about Terrorism in the widest sense – even including terror of an authoritarian parent. Violence is basically employed because we are unable to deal with the complexity of choice. To democratically make a decision is to deal with multiple perspectives, which could to doubting your own opinions as well. So people with power, of position, gun or state, exert that power to end the debate so that they need not live in doubt any more. :Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
To introduce an anti-malarial vaccine without birth control is to tear a culture apart:Think deeply, you’ll understand Systems Thinking with this quote.:Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
As overchoice deepens, the person lacking clear grasp of his own values is progressively crippled.:Your values are super-decisions you make that simplify your life. When faced with the paralyzing effect of overchoice, values act as a filter. I value minimalism that helps me filter out a lot of choices available as I shop for anything.:Alvin Toffler – Future Shock
All great men are play actors fo their own ideal.:Every great person should start as an imposter. You set an ambitious goal which your current self cannot achieve at the moment. You become an imposter and be an actor believing that you can do it. That’s the only way to push boundaries and be on the path to greatness.:Friedrich Nietzsche – Beyond Good and Evil
The maturity of man—that means, to have reacquired the seriousness that one had as a child at play.:A child at play is nothing but great focus and will to win the game. They are full of purpose. It is the adults that are playing their games with least intent and will. Maturity is to find intention, purpose and will back.:Friedrich Nietzsche – Beyond Good and Evil
One loves ultimately one’s desires, not the thing desired.:I try to remember this quote whenever I believe I love <something>. It makes me detached from the thing. The desire can be fulfilled by various other things and I need not be desperate about one particular thing.:Friedrich Nietzsche – Beyond Good and Evil
Desire (kama) is the force that creates the world; Destiny (karma) is the counter-force that limits satisfaction of desires:We are born with certain destinies, privileges or oppressions, that determine our social roles. The destiny of a water drop on a hill is to reach the valley due to gravity. But desire can change destiny. If you desire to stop the movement of the water drop, you can change its destiny by building a dam. But can you always change your destinies? Can we bring harmony between our desires and destinies?:Devdutt Pattanaik – my Hanuman Chalisa
We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking:Habits form even before we are conscious of them. This is not just about regular habits. People marry and make living with the partner a habit even before thinking if that’s the best decision for them. Many such habits that stops one from living a well examined life.:Albert Camus – Myth of Sisyphus
I'm filled with a desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither:A precise definition of absurdism. You are screaming at the world for answers but the world remains silent. We have to live in this absurd world. And it’s not something to despair. There is freedom in it. Absurd freedom.:Albert Camus – Myth of Sisyphus
Become so very free that your whole existence is an act of rebellion:The ultimate freedom Camus speaks about is the freedom from finding meaning of life. Our desperation to find meaning in life is often exploited. Be free of it and you will be the absurd hero.:Albert Camus – Myth of Sisyphus
