But man’s duty is to try and endeavour; success depends upon chance and environments:Singh made this statement explaining his journey towards atheism. There were testing times at which Singh was tempted to use little bit of myticism to make his disbeleif in god more poetic. Akin to modern Atheists who say that they are spiritual. But Singh termed this as intoxication. He wanted to be a realist and overcame the temptation to rely on mysticism. Singh agrees that he was not successful always. But man’s duty is to try; success depends upon chance and envrionments. :Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Criticism and independent thinking are two indispensable qualities of a revolutionary:Singh spoke of the mentality of the masses that oppose one to be a sceptic. The mentality that relies on faith. He advocated for reason. He advocated criticism and independent thinking for human progress and not relying on faith.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Beleif softens the hardships even can make them pleasant:Singh recalled his experience in the jail when a couple of well meaning police-men asked him to pray. He agreed that beleif in god and religion allows one to deal with hardships better. One can even give pleasant meanings to the hardships by taking recourse to religion. Nevertheless  Singh refused to pray. He was a stauch realist.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
A short life of struggle with no maginificient end shall in itself be the reward:Singh said that religious people do good activities with selfish motives – for heavens or to be reborn as Kings. Singh fought for freedom not expecting any after-life reward. He knew that life or soul would end the moment he get hanged. He believed that if more people work for the mankind for the mere reward in it and not for any after life rewards  that would initiate the era of liberty.:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Non-Violence as a policy is indispensable for all mass movements:Singh’s thoughts about violence changed a lot as he grew. When young he was an active advocator of violence against the British Empire. However as he read more and gained experience in the freedom struggle his thoughts changed. He believed that force is justifiable only in times of terrible necessity. And to organise mass movements non-violence is indispensable:Bhagat Singh – Why I’am an Atheist?
Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence:Used in the context of pseudo-science. Whenever anyone comes up with an extraordinary claim, the onus is on them to also bring extraordinary evidence to prove that claim.:Carl Sagan
Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both:Sagan spoke about exploring the Cosmos here. Without imagination, one cannot think further and step into unchartered territories. Skepticism helps in distinguishing facts from fancy. It tests our imagination.:Carl Sagan – Cosmos
Parents are defined by their mistakes:This line was a slap on my face. I often judged my parents for their mistakes. I ignored all other facets of life in which they were great. This line made me practice gratitude for my parents. I struggle to express my love to them, so hope they read this!:Fredrik Backman – Anxious People
There was an unexpected freedom in finding out that one wasn’t as important as one had always assumed:There is freedom in insignificance. I used to stress a lot thinking that I’m extremely important. But I was replaced very easily. I felt bad initally but I realised that this insignificance gave me immense freedom. I stress less now. And I read astronomy often to remember my insignificance.:Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni – Palace of Illusions
There is only one sin. That is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft.:As I reflect back, all terrible things that I have done are variations of thefts. Stealed people’s peace of mind, time etc. Stealing money now appears a less intense variant of theft.:Khaled Hosseini – Kite Runner
Stories are equipment for living:The reason why I write and act. We humans evolved through stories. They are part of us. No matter what you do, you are always looking for stories. Great stories become civilisational values. They shape culture. And the greatest good you can do for humanity is to tell a good story. Either through your life, work, writings or movies!:Kenneth Burke
Love cuts two ways – we possess it when we give it freedom, but destory it with possessiveness:I learnt it the hard way. There is a thin line between love and obsession. And your love towards someone can easily become obsession. The moment it becomes obsession, you strangulate the other person and destory love. If you cannot trust the other person with freedom, don’t live in a denial that you love them.:Robert Mckee – Story
Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still:I have no clue about my career and life. There are so many things I like and want to pursue seriously. For years I have struggled incorporating these interests in my life. I felt guilty doing the exploration. However, I am slowly coming to terms with my nature. If exploration is what I want, I will do that. A little responsibly. :Carl Sagan – Cosmos
He’d really done something to be proud of now – no one could say he was just a famous name any more:Harry Potter was always given respect because of his parents. But when he won the Quidditch match for Gryffindor, he got a genuine applause. The kind of validation one gets for their true talent and effort is beautiful.:J.K Rowling – Harry Potter and the philosopher’s stone
