            <p>
                At the beginning of a Turkish movie "Sevimli Tehlikeli", a small girl refuses to accept a narration as a Story 
                if the narration doesn't start with "Once upon a time". So here it goes... 
            </p>

            <p>
                Once upon a time, I was born in Hyderabad, the emerging capital of Indian cinema, to a family that has love-hate relationship with cinema.
                Love for the art form; Hate for the business and culture of it. So for the love of it, my mom sent me to music classes;
                father sent me to dance classes; and now I do theatre and cinema.
            </p>
            <p> 
                And because of the hate, everyone ensured that I studied well.
                <br>
                Long story short, I studied Mechanical Engineering at NITK Surathkal and Public Policy with the UPSC exam.
                I developed interest in using technology for public problems.
                I'm happy that I found opportunities in using data technologies to solve problems in Urbanisation, Flood management, Air pollution and Social science research in general.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I've travelled wide ideologically. I almost became part of the R.S.S when lack of public transport and my discomfort with commuting helped me from not attending the induction ceremony.
                Later, I pivoted to the Marx, Gandhism, Dr.B.R.Ambedkar etc. I learned that no one is perfect, which seems very obvious now.
                I stopped taking ideological stances and try to maintain an independent thought - People from all ideologies do give me material in that regard.
            </p>
            <p> 
                I'm an existentialist. I believe that life has no god-given purpose or meaning. Individuals should create their own meaning, which might appear meaningless to others.
                If money is the measure of value, freedom is the measure of life. <a href="https://d-saikrishna.github.io/Blogs/Anviksiki/freedom-framework.html">I try to maximise freedom</a> for a better life and most of my decisions reflect this.
