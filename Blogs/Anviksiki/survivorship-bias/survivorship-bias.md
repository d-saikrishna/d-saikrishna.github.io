# Survivorship Bias

‚Äú Hollywood movies are better than Indian movies dude ‚Äù

‚Äú Telugu movies are nothing compared to Malayalam movies‚Äù

I kept hearing these statements throughout my college.

Initially, I used to respond to them egotistically. Wherever there is ego, there is anger and I had many arguments defending Telugu / Indian movies.

But then a better understanding of psychology, in general, helped me understand the cause of these statements.

So, no one did any qualitative research to say which industry is better. All the statements are subjective opinions. And opinions are prone to be biased ‚Äî

Survivorship bias acts extraordinarily well here.

Survivorship bias is a logical error in which we concentrate only on a sample that survives a criterion. All our analysis is then based on this narrow sample. So how does this bias act in our movies‚Äô context?

Whatever movies you generally know from other languages are subject to survivorship bias. Only the best movies in other languages generally survive to reach you.

But on the other hand, you have access to all good and bad movies in your language.

You compare apples with oranges and make those statements.

This is the very reason why we also say old movies are better than new ones.

Because, only good old movies survive today ‚Äì and we compare them with both good and bad movies of today.

So, to conclude, do you want to know which industry makes good movies according to me?

Nothing and everything.

I‚Äôm not egoistic about the language / region now.

I love movies.

Every industry makes extraordinary movies. Better to savour them rather than getting into these biased debates.
