# Why anecdotal evidence is BS?

I recently attended a meetup where a couple of persons spoke about telepathy, quite passionately. They told that their own mother used to telepathatically communicate with her brother and other anecdotal evidence. I thought of digging deep into the issue and found how basic math and psychology can provide an answer.

**The math part:**
If I say, “you are currently thinking about your ex-girlfriend/boyfriend”, I’m sure at least one of my 202 readers would agree to it. The probability of me getting this prediction right with a specific individual is extremely small – 1 in hundreds of topics one could think of. But the probability of me getting my prediction right among the hundreds of readers is decent. Let’s do the math.

There is an 87% chance that one of you feels that I predicted your thought correctly. Which means, I should be able to receive atleast 1 comment, to this post saying that I was able to do online telepathy with you. :p

It doesn’t stop here. If I continuously make predictions every day, the number of comments saying I’m doing telepathy also increase every day. 1+1+1+1 ….. all of them claiming that Sai Krishna baba can do telepathy, and also talk to ghosts, dogs and aliens. (So much I wish to talk to my dog)

Hope you understand that how much ever big this 1+1+1+1….. become, they are still ANECDOTAL. My readers are just 200. What if I have 11.2M subscribers like Sadhguru? I can then receive about 1 lakh comments every day that I have telepathy powers. All of them are still ANECDOTAL!

And this is how people use anecdotal evidence to spread pseudoscience. Any random thing (A number, star pattern, black cat, sitting in a particular position) can have a coincidence with hundreds of people — because we are billions in population. That doesn’t mean that the random thing CAUSED it. All types of superstitions with numerology, astrology, synchronicity (some new thing I learnt today) are peddled because we don’t do this basic math. All your favourite babas are enjoying their cult fame because of this. I’m sorry. But that’s the truth. They just tell 100 thousand things and every thing will obviously have anecdotal evidence.

**The psychology part:**

This is simple, we humans are biased to extreme events and remember them. The meetup person’s mother remembered those events in which she could correctly guess what her brother was thinking. But the brother-sister duo would have probably interacted thousands of times in their lives. Was she able to guess it all the time? No one measured it. No one bothers to remember the routine.

And thus, anecdotal evidence is a bull shit. Let’s take a real time example to further this point. Sadhguru said that 11 is a powerful number because a lot of cosmological, religious events coincided with that number. There are lakhs of cosmological and religious events – any random number will have a lot of coincidences. This pastor uncle says that 222 is a special number. Many more across religions and cultures. Now let’s see some anecdotal evidence?

Go through the comments and you will see many more hilarious ones. ( at least laugh at the faith you don’t belong to).

I repeat – Anecdotal evidence is bullshit. And instead prefer scientific evidence. Thank you.
