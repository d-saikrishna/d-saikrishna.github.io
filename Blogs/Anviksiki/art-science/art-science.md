# Art or Science?

My friend Nanda and I are often inclined to label anything "Science" because that label gives us confidence that we can learn it as well. I cannot even draw a line straight, so anything "Art" is something I tend to keep away.

But ever since I started doing theatre and reading/writing fiction, Art became part of my life. I kept searching for "Science of storytelling", "Science of acting", etc., because terming it Science makes it achievable for me. But am I cheating myself here? The world calls it Art, without any reason? I want to explore this question in this blog.

## What is Science?

Textbooks say Science is the study of nature. I don't like this definition. It is too vague and allows many charlatans to appropriate the word.

I put it this way: **Science is the method which separates what works from what does not work**. For instance, it was believed that diseases like cholera were caused by "bad air" called miasma, which emanates from rotting organic matter. With the discovery of germ theory, it was identified that specific germs cause specific diseases - not miasma. Science helped us prove that miasma theory doesn't work, but germ theory works.

Science lies on verifiability and repeatability. If you say that a certain thing works in certain conditions, I should be able to repeat it and get same results. Eg: If both of us add lemon juice to luke warm milk(~45‚Å∞C) and stay for 4-5 hours, both of us should be able to make curd. Otherwise, it cannot be Science.

*There is a caveat: both of us should do this curd experiment in same(~similar) conditions. If you are in Kashmir and I'm in Thar desert, we may not get same results. Remember this caveat.*

## What is Art?

**Art is something that evokes emotions**. In Natyasastra, Bharata Muni listed down eight emotions (rasas) that can be evoked through art. These are
1. Sringara (Love, Romance)
2. Hasya (Comedy, Laughter)
3. Raudra (Anger)
4. Karuna (Sadness, Compassion)
5. Bhayanaka (Fear)
6. Veera (Pride)
7. Adbhuta (Wonder)
8. Bhibatsa (Disgust)

Later authors added another rasa
9. Shanta (Peace)

I feel Urooj Ashfaq is an amazing artist because she evokes laughter in me.

But, you may not find her funny. Even if we are in the same auditorium, sitting adjacent to each other, experiencing same temperature, sound quality etc., we could have opposite opinions on her jokes.

Because, even though our external conditions are similar, our internal conditions vary a lot. Our minds are different because of our parents, schooling, friends, childhood traumas, books we read, movies we watched etc. It is infinitely impossible that two minds are completely same. Thus, the same joke works differently for both of us. Unlike the curd, which forms alike in similar conditions.

Hence, artists have to find the right audience. If the intended effect of a movie scene is to evoke love, but the audience feel disgusted watching it, the movie failed with that audience.

Good artists understand their audience well and deliver the promised emotion.

Great artists can cater promised emotion to a great number of audience.

## Is cooking art or science?

Taking notes from the curd experiment, Cooking has to be science right?

The mechanics of it are surely, Science. [masalalab](https://www.instagram.com/_masalalab/?hl=en) is all about documenting the science of Indian cooking.

But, food also evokes emotions!

We did this acting exercise in theatre. Our trainer asked all actors to bring some food from our homes and then we take turns to distribute our food with all actors. Only condition is that everyone should close their eyes while tasting. We were then asked to tell what emotion each food item triggered. I closed my eyes and my theatre friend placed some rava kesari on my hand. Just by the fragrance and texture of it, I got reminded of my grand mother and the festivals during which she used to make this sweet. However, the same sweet triggered disgust in my fellow actor who hates sweets.

How to make that sweet is definitely Science. 
What that Sweet does to people is Art.

Our mothers and grandmothers are great Artists with respect to Cooking because they know their audience well. They know what to cook when I'm sad and happy. They can invoke right emotions through food.

I showed this blog till here to Nanda to check if it clarified our doubts. He asked another interesting question.

## You give the same script to different filmmakers and they would all make different films. Why?

There was this doubt in cooking also. Do different cooks cook alike if given the same recipe? Yes. However, it's incredibly hard to achieve this (and thus there are few restaurant chains that can maintain standard taste across). Chefs go into extreme details and document the Science of a recipe to make it repeatable.

Can we do the same with Filmmaking? I'm inclined to say Yes, but I'm not finding any sort of evidence to say so.

Filmmaking involves a lot of emotional decisions to be made. Say both of us have to shoot a scene in which a [guy wants to send birthday wishes to his ex-partner but he is anxious](https://shorted.in/short-films/unsent-romance-drama/). The script is the same.

 1. What color palette will you choose?
 2. Where will you place the camera?
 3. What music will you play?
 
 These all are emotional decisions. Even though both of us want to evoke Karuna (sadness) in audience, different colors, camera angles, tunes evoke this emotion in us personally. There are hundreds of such emotional decisions to be made in filmmaking, making it an Art.

This applies to any art form. Consider painting where the number of variables are lesser than filmmaking.

Two painters intending to communicate the same idea and evoke the same emotion will still paint different pieces. They are making emotional decisions with every stroke of their brush. Each stroke evokes different emotions in each of them.

## Can we make Art, a Science?
Can I, like a Chef, document an art into its extreme details, achieve repeatability and make it a Science?

We saw that the extreme details of artform involves emotions.

To make filmmaking, painting, music etc., into a Science., we should be able to document these emotions precisely. What emotion will each camera angle, color, tune evoke? With AI and all, this seems possible, right?

Here's where the concept called EmotionTech comes. It is part of the AI bandwagon and it is trying to detect all those navarasas in humans using facial recognition. Before we proceed, [IT IS PSEUDOSCIENCE](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/ai-emotion-recognition-is-a-pseudoscientific). It doesn't work. We humans are weird creatures; we lie, act and fake emotions all the time. Just see yourself in your next zoom call if you need proof.

Chefs, fortunately don't have to deal with emotional decisions. If bacteria had had emotions, we would not be able to make curd today.

## Living in harmony with Art and Science

To reiterate, Art stirs emotions. And emotions are needed for decision making. ([Ref: Descarte'e Error](https://medium.com/tiago-books/book-review-descartes-error-emotion-reason-and-the-human-brain-7576673a5802))

If you cut off emotions in a person, she would be able to make all logical analysis of the problem but will not be able to make a decision.

I got to live in harmony Art and Science, thanks to my work on GIS. 

There is a lot of Science stuff that is needed to make a geospatial analysis. The coordinate systems, projections, statistics, physics of light, Satellites etc. Once all of it is done, we have to build a map and show it to the decision maker. Do you know what we discuss at the end? **Colors!**. What colors should we use to represent the values on map? All the Science stuff appears so easy when compared to this question. Because this final question is a question of Art. Different color evokes different emotions. Different emotions motivate different decisions.

**Cartography is thus both Science and an Art.**

Given my interest with stories and films, I explore another opportunity for this harmony.

Science, when presented artistically, can evoke the beautiful emotion of Adbhuta (Wonder). This is what Carl Sagan did to me with his book and documentary Cosmos. This is what VS Ramachandran did to me with his book "Phantoms in the Brain". I really hope more such stories are told so that science touches us emotionally and thus helps us make decisions.
