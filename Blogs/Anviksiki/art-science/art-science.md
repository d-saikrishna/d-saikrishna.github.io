# Art or Science?

This is one of the most important decisions we've had to make very early in our lives.

My friend Nanda and I are often biased to call anything "Science" because it gives us confidence that we can learn it as well. I cannot even draw a line straight, so anything "Art" is generally tend to keep it away.

But ever since I started doing theatre and reading/writing fiction, Art became part of my life. I kept seraching for "Science of storytelling", "Science of acting", etc., because terming it Science makes it achievable for me. But am I cheating myself here? The world calls it Art, without any reason? I want to explore this question in this blog.

**What is Science?**

Textbooks say it is the study of nature. I don't like this definition. It is too vague and allows many charlatans to appropriate the word.

To put it simply, Science is the method which separates what works from what does not work. For instance, it was believed that diseases like cholera were caused by "bad air" called miasma, which emanates from rotting organic matter. With the discovery of germ theory, it was identified that specific germs cause specific diseases - not miasma. Science helped us prove that miasma theory doesn't work, but germ theory works.

Science also lies on verifiability and repeatability. If you say that certain thing works in certain conditions, I should be able to repeat it and get same results. Eg: If both of us add lemon juice to luke warm milk(~45‚Å∞C) and stay for 4-5 hours, both of us should be able to make curd. Otherwise, it cannot be Science.

*There is a caveat: both of us should do this curd experiment in same(~similar) conditions. If you are in Kashmir and I'm in Thar desert, we may not get same results. Remember this caveat.*

**What is Art?**

A simple definition of Art is **something that evokes emotions**. In Natyasastra, Bharata Muni listed down eight emotions (rasas) that can be evoked through art. These are
1. Sringara (Love, Romance)
2. Hasya (Comedy, Laughter)
3. Raudra (Anger)
4. Karuna (Sadness, Compassion)
5. Bhayanaka (Fear)
6. Veera (Pride)
7. Adbhuta (Wonder)
8. Bhibatsa (Disgust)

Later authors added another rasa
9. Shanta (Peace)

I feel Urooj Ashfaq is an amazing artist because she evokes laughter in me.

But, you may not find her funny. Even if we are in the same auditorium, sitting adjacent to each other, experiencing same temperature, sound quality etc., we could have opposite opinions on her jokes.

Because, even though the external conditions we have are similar, our internal conditions would vary a lot. Our minds are different because of our parents, schooling, friends, childhood traumas, books we read, movies we watched etc., And it is infinitely impossible that two minds are completely same. And thus, the same joke works differently for both of us. Unlike the curd.

Hence, artists have to find the right audience. If the intended effect of a movie scene is to evoke love, but the audience feel disgusted watching it, the movie failed with that audience.

Great artists understand their audience well and deliver the promised emotion.

**Is cooking art or science?**

Taking notes from the curd experiment, Cooking has to be science right?

The mechanics of it are surely Science. @masalalab is all bout documenting the science of Indian cooking.

But, food also evokes emotions!

We did this in theatre. We were asked to bring some food from our homes and then everyone shares eats each other's food by closing eyes. We were then asked to tell what emotion each food triggered. I closed my eyes and my theatre friend placed some kesari bath in my hand. Just by the fragrance and texture of it, I got reminded of my grand mother and the festive vibes. The same sweet triggered disgust in another pperosn who hates sweets.

How to make that sweet is definitely Science. 
What that Sweet does to people is Art.

Our mothers and grandmothers are great Artists with respect to Cooking because they know their audience well. They know what to cook when I'm sad and happy. They can invoke right emotions through food.

Now I can answer my original question.

There is probably science in how to write a story, joke or a movie.
But what that story, joke, movie does to people is Art.

**Can we make Art, a Science?**
