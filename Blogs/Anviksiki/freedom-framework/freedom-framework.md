# The Freedom framework

Decision-making is hard and sometimes paralysing – in our personal lives and as bureaucrats and heads of nations.

To come out of this paralysis, we develop some framework. All data we collect to make a ‘data-driven decision’ is basically a way to organise the data in the chosen framework.

For instance, one might decide on a job switch using Money as a framework. If a company offers more salary, that data point in the money framework makes us choose the new job.

Money, being measurable, is a good and easy framework to have. At the policy level, this money framework takes the form of GDP.

But, GDP has its limitations. It alone doesn’t capture if people are happier; if the environment is healthy.

Similarly, the Money framework won’t capture our happiness.

I follow the 𝐅𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤.

In which, my decision-making is based on answering this question- “𝐢𝐬 𝐦𝐲 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐛𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐝𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧?”

It’s both “freedom from” restraints and “freedom to” do things of my interest.

Sometimes it’s more money that expands my freedom. Sometimes, foregoing money expands my freedom. Sometimes learning a new skill brings freedom.

I feel I’ve been taking better personal decisions with the freedom framework.

At a macro level, are our policy decisions expanding the freedom of people? People’s freedom from restraints of poverty and social evils. Freedom to do things of their interest. Marry a person of their choice.

PS: Freedom is not an absolute concept. As J.S.Mill said, 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐨𝐦 𝐭𝐨 𝐬𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐬 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐭𝐢𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐦𝐲 𝐧𝐨𝐬𝐞.
