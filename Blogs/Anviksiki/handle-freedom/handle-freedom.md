# You want freedom, but can you handle it?

We all suffer from “fear of freedom” psychologically. Many psychoanalysts have proved it. We are so used to being dependent and submissive, as a child, student, etc., that managing freedom responsibly gives us bonkers. And our inability to handle our own freedom causes immense harm to us individually and collectively.

Individually, it limits our potential. Too afraid to be free, we become submissive and end up in new dependencies. Instead of being in a free association with people, we will be in submissive association with people, be it, life partners or employers.

Collectively, the fear of freedom transforms us from individuals into mass society. We surrender our faculty of critical thinking and join the herd because we find a semblance of security and comfort to be in a group. This mass society is easy to manage for a totalitarian leader. The leader often appeals to our irrational fears and dark passions to destroy any remnants of individuality and critical thought. Fear of freedom is thus said to be one of the reasons behind the rise of Fascism in Germany and Italy.

We have two paths.

One is to be an individual with free and independent thought and action.

Two is to be scared of freedom and join the un-thinking masses.

The first path could be isolated but full of creativity and life. The second path, we will see soon where it takes us.

A sheep might find security and comfort in the herd, but she will be slaughtered in the end, by the shepherd.
