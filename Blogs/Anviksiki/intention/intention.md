# Intentionality

Macbeth rehearsals. I was playing the role of MacDuff. I discovered that my beloved King Duncan had got murdered and I entered the stage with horror.

"CUT" screamed my theater trainers.

"You entered because you HAVE to enter. Not because you WANT to enter. You lacked intention", they remarked. Without intention, there is no truth in the act. I was just faking it.

After a few more rehearsals, I probably got it right.

This "lack of intentionality" continued to haunt me. Not just on stage. I felt I lacked intentionality at other things in life as well. More importantly, I lacked intentionality in the information I consumed. If thoughts and opinions are a result of the information we consume, then, I lacked intentionality in the thoughts and opinions I held. Without intention, these are not my authentic thoughts. I am just a parrot.

So, I wanted to work on intentional consumption of information. Which means, I should not allow algorithms that optimise engagement to choose information for me. They would only choose information which is polarising, violent and trigger our primitive instincts. They inturn make us addicts to this information and we become zombies in the echo chambers they create.

I switched off from these algorithms by resorting to books. I am not arguing that there is 100% free will in the selection of books that I read. But they are relatively more intentional than the algorithm recommended information. I do consume videos from YouTube and podcasts, but generally refrain from choosing "recommended videos".

Is this a case against recommendation algorithms? No! Every algorithm has to optimise some metric. I have a problem with the metrics these algorithms are optimising - **Engagement**. As a human, I'm unfortunately more engaged to information that brings out the worst in me. I cannot help it. If algorithms can optimise for a metric that brings out the best in me, I am glad to rely on them. For instance, I have no issue relying on algorithms that recommend me music. They haven't harmed me but only brought the best of the world's music to me. 

To be intentional has been tough but rewarding. My screen time has reduced to less than 2 hours a day. I limited mindless scrolling and useless picking up of my phone. And yes, probably I'm a better actor now :)
