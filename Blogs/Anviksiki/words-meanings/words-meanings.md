# Words and meanings

"I hate Hinduism" tweeted a bird on X. 
A few other birds tweeted, "I hate Secularism"; "I love Sanathana Dharma" etc.,

Despite the differences in their love and hate, there was one commonality among them.

**None of them knew what these words mean** - Hinduism, Secularism, Sanathana Dharma etc. 

And yet, they were able to develop strong emotions of love and hate towards them. They would vote and do politics based on these emotions. They are willing to recreate a new world based on their emotions.

All this not even knowing the meaning of the words.

But why? Why have we developed this bad thinking?

The fallacy of **guilt by association** gives one explanation. Let me explain.

Even though we don't know meanings of these words, we know with whom these words got associated often.

Ajinomoto got associated with China (Chinese Salt), despite it being a Japanese company that makes MSG.
<br>The word Secularism got associated with Congress Party.
<br>The word Hinduism got associated with the BJP.

So if you hate China, you'll carry forward that hate to MSG as well.<br> 
If you hate Congress, you'd carry forward that hatred for Secularism as well.<br>
If you hate BJP, you'd carry forward that hatred for Hinduism as well.

I'm not passing a judgment here whether MSG, Secularism or Hindusim deserves hate or not. You are free to decide that.
But decide based on your understanding of these words. Not on the basis of their associations.

There is a quirky quote by Dr. Anand Ranganathan, "If Modi promotes Pranayama, Modi haters would stop breathing". This is guilt by association.

Problematic people can hold decent opinions. <br>
Decent people can hold problematic opinions.

We should be able to judge the issue at hand without getting distracted.
