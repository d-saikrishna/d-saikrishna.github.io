        <p>
            Certain concepts helped me think rationally. This is a dictionary of those concepts.

        <h4>Freedom framework</h4>
        <p>
            If money is a measure of value, freedom is the measure of life.
            I've been consciously prioritising freedom over other things while I make decisions.

            This question follows the previous blog. Given that you are granted with absolute freedom, can you handle it?

        <h4>Here is the data. Show me the action!</h4>

            “We have all the information on how bad air pollution is and how it causes a lot of health problems. Yet, where is the Action taken?” asked Maja Daruwala.
            This question sent me down the memory lane of my therapy sessions. Luckily on Day 2, I found case studies to articulate my thoughts.

        <h4>Why anecdotal evidence is BS?</h4>
        <p>
            People give you anecdotal evidence to justify all sorts of non-sense. You want to tell them that anecdotal evidence is useless.
            But their stories are very strong and emotional. Hence, let's use same math to call out anecdotal evidence.
            Don't worry, we just use high school math for this.

        <h4>Bayesian Thinking for a better world</h4>
        <p>
            We all start with problematic opinions - be it about gender, castes, religions etc.
            But when the world shows you counter evidence, are you updating your opinions?
            If not, you are not thinking well. Let some high school math show you why and how to update opinions.

            If you believe that old movies are better or that Hollywood is superior, there is an element of Survivorship bias in your beleif.
            Why not keep it in control?

        <h4>Biases that make us bad thinkers</h4>
        <p>
            Bias (పక్షపాతం) is basically an opinion formed on the basis of a very small sample size.
            Since humans cannot survey the entire population, we all have biases. The best we can do is be conscious of them. Why?

        <p>
            Given the time crunch, we rely on others to make decisions in our lives.
            These others are the decision baits and you ought to be careful with them.
