        <h4>Freedom framework</h4>
        <p>
            If money is a measure of value, freedom is the measure of life.
            I've been consciously prioritising freedom over other things while I make decisions.

        <h4>Why anecdotal evidence is BS?</h4>
        <p>
            People give you anecdotal evidence to justify all sorts of non-sense. You want to tell them that anecdotal evidence is useless.
            But their stories are very strong and emotional. Hence, let's use same math to call out anecdotal evidence.
            Don't worry, we just use high school math for this.
