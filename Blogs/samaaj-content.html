            My photographer asked me to give me a "mass expression." My neurons started to churn listening to that phrase.
            I don't know if I succeeded in giving a mass expression, but it was fun understanding the etymology of it.

            Engineers in India often feel alienated from the society. They feel that their role in nation building is insiginificant.
            It could be because of the way we approach professional education - for money, job and security.
            But at a time when the nation is on the road to be a digital nation, Engineers should not see themselves as mere technologists.
            Engineers should read the Constitution, ethics, humanities and be more conscious of their role in the society.
            <br>
            This is a small story in this regard.
