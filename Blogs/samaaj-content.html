            Engineers in India often feel alienated from the society. They feel that their role in nation building is insiginificant.
            It could be because of the way we approach professional education - for money, job and security.
            But at a time when the nation is on the road to be a digital nation, Engineers should not see themselves as mere technologists.
            Engineers should read the Constitution, ethics, humanities and be more conscious of their role in the society.
