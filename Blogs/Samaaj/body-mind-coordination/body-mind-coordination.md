# Body mind coordination

Imagine your mind asking you to take a right but you steer your car left (and crash). Or your mind asking you to feed yourself through your mouth, but your hands poke the fork on your face.

Medical conditions like Ataxia are about such lack of body-mind coordination. These conditions are generally attributed to the brain – not to muscles. Neurology is the branch of medicine that deals with it.

But, when a similar failure of body-mind coordination happens at the organizational, national or civilisational level – we complain about the ineffectiveness of the body rather than that of the mind. Why is it so?

For instance, [Economist 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐏𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐭𝐭 termed India a “𝑭𝒍𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑺𝒕𝒂𝒕𝒆”.](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/4449106)

It means a state whose head (elite institutions) is extremely well-functional but is not well connected to its limbs (lower bureaucracy). A lack of body-mind coordination is what he explained as the reason for good policies but lousy implementation. However, he appreciates the mind and attributes India’s poor developmental indicators to its limbs.

But what if this failure of body-mind coordination is a failure of the mind? That is what the scientist 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐥 𝐒𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐧 argues from a civilizational point of view.

Ionians (Ancient Greece) were once famous for Science. They worked on astronomy, geometry, etc. But the advent of 𝐬𝐥𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 led to the decline of Science in Ionia. Scientific experimentation is a ‘dirty’ work done by hand. Once slavery came into existence, the slave-holders distanced themselves from ‘dirty’ hand work. And the slaves were not given any knowledge, opportunity and leisure to think or to do science.

𝐀𝐬 𝐚 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭 – 𝐧𝐨 𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐝 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞.

The slaves did slavery; The slave-holders did armchair philosophy.

Carl Sagan argues that the decline of Science in the Indian, Aztec, Mayan and several civilisations is also for a similar reason. The hierarchical organisations in these societies distanced limbs from the head. In fact, the caste system literally delineates which caste came from the head and which caste came from the foot.

The Body-Mind coordination problem continues today.

And I disagree with Lant Pritchett in calling it a problem of the limbs. It is, in fact, a problem of the mind.

Minds in many organisations and nations don’t even know what the limbs are experiencing. There is a lack of representation and influence for the limbs in the mind.

There is disdain for manual labour. There is disdain for dirty hand work.

And such a mind, with disdain for limbs, will do armchair philosophy and make unimplementable policies that pull us down together.

As Pranay Kotasthane says, an [unimplementable policy is a bad policy despite having good intentions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2LPvOkwSdU&t=5s). An unimplementable policy is the product of a failed mind, not of a limb.
