# Revolution through Vote

In his last correspondence, Bhagat Singh claimed that he was not a terrorist but a revolutionary.

Terrorism is an individual act of violence to terrorise people. But, revolution changes the social order.

He wanted to inspire a revolution in the masses so that the British Raj feels it can no longer enslave them. Violence was his method because, in his opinion, there was no other way to change the order in an imperialistic regime. He wanted to use violence to make the deaf hear, not to harm. So he threw smoke bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly.

Revolutions need a critical threshold of mass participation to succeed. If very few people revolt, it is easily suppressed by the status-quo powers. That is why many abstain from revolting because they feel they alone cannot change things. But someone has to start to inspire that threshold mass.

Bhagat Singh, Chandrasekhar Azad, Sukhdev etc., wanted to be those initiators. They knew they wouldn’t live to experience the fruits of independence. Yet, revolutions need the sacrifice of the initiators.

Today, we live in a democracy.

Revolutions today are possible through VOTE.

Even now, a critical threshold of voters is required to bring change.

Many voters don’t vote for promising alternatives feeling that their individual vote alone would do no help. They go on voting for the status quo.

However, fortunately, initiators of revolution today need no great sacrifices of the likes of Bhagat Singh. It needs no violence, but just a vote. And when that vote becomes a part of the critical threshold, you create a new social order.

It is easy to be Bhagat Singh today.

He had to throw bombs in the Assembly to make the deaf hear.

You just have to vote responsibly to make the deaf hear.
