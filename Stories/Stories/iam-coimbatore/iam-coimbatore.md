# The city speaks

If you are not special, you should atleast make special friends to get rich. That is how I became rich. Second richest in my family. All thanks to my mountain friends around me. People love to visit them, take selfies and live close to them. And because of my network, they cannot bypass me.

How I made these friends is a tremendous story in itself. No, I didn’t meet them in a school. Nor I was asked to partner up with a stranger in a writing club. Continents had to break-up for me to have friends. Literally. 

So my mom, Koyamma, used to tell me this family tale. We are not originally from this area. We are from down south, real south, the Southern Hemisphere. And then, we migrated – for millions of years. Our migration only stopped because of an accident. Our Continent collided with the one above and my friends took birth out of that destruction.

Seeing my chaotic past, no one would give me work. But people would come to see my friends often. Since I stay on their way, I got a lot of business. The elephants at the foothills also added to my business because white foreigners are crazy about seeing elephants. My friends keep me cool even in summers by strategically letting air pass through their gaps. If not for them, my home would’ve become dry like that idiot Erode’s.

My friends also married me to River Siruvani. She is the sweetest in the world. She collects fresh water from all my friends and brings it home. She reminds me of my hometown. She cooks fish which is exactly the same you would find in Madagascar today. I also eat Kothu Parota and Kalan. People do not eat it together , don’t know why. You should try!

Well, you cannot say I live off my friends. They did help me, but today I’m an independent adult. I own hundreds of textile mills. People come to me not just for mountains anymore. People come to me to become engineers. Just throw a stone standing on the Avinashi road and it’ll hit an Engineer. People come to me to become spiritual. I host the world’s largest Shiva statue. I’ve also learnt to speak Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, mixed and the last two and created a new language Badaga. I’m one of the most cosmopolitan places in India today. I’m Coimbatore!
