# Longing for love

For an aeon of time, poets wrote how love makes life worthy to live. May be that's the only thing that answers my existential crisis. Who is going to love me though? What good am I apart from carrying a good odour?

To help in finding love, my friends and I are showcased on the streets of Chikmagalur. Humans come to us, date us and take the one they love. Best smelling friends of mine have already been taken by white humans from across the ocean. Average folks like me are only left with desi humans.

As we long for love, we have a guilty pleasure of rating humans who come to see us. If you are stingy with money and bargain a lot, you get a 4 on 10. If you keep thinking who is the best one for you, you get a 3 on 10. If you ever ask if I'm fresh, then fuck you. Sadly, I never found anyone above 5. Will I ever find love? Will I be forced to be with a person I dislike? The thought of this gave me shivers.

One day, a bunch of telugu speaking humans came to select their suitors. The one wearing black shirt is hot - 8 on 10 by looks. After a long time, I felt the urge inside me. I was so enamoured by his smile that I didn't notice the guy next to him pushing his dirty sweaty hand in the bag I live. He grabbed me up close to his nose and started sniffing me like a dog. His hand's smell must have overpowered mine; he threw me down from the height back into my bag. Few of my friends fell on the floor and he stamped on them, killing them of their odour.

The Black shirt guy came next. He lifted me up softly; his hands were as smooth as leaves of pepper plant. He smelled me and boy - that joy on his face when smelled me. I felt this is like my destiny. To bring that joy on his face - again and again. I hope he takes me.

And he did! He took me along with a few of my friends so that I'd not be alone. He took good care of us through out the journey. He protected us from random asses and ensured we have enough air to breathe. When we reached Hyderabad, he has put us in a fancy glass jar so that we can see the world outside. He's lovely! I'll give him sleepless nights :)

Everyday, I see that face of Joy when he smells my friends after bathing them with hot water. The way he sighs after tasting us - Omg, its giving me goosebumps. I am waiting for my chance to do the same for him. I am supposed to be the next but he asked his maid to clean the jar and I sunk down with her violent vigorous wipes. It hurt.

Finally, the day has arrived. He picked me up. He took me close to his nose. I'm ecstatic that I'm going to fulfill my karma. I can see his joyous face very close. I'd be bathed in hot water. He would taste me and then I'd become part of him. My dream collapsed as put me back in the jar. Why? He never did this to my friends. My friends started to ridicule me that I smell bad. I felt bad.

I noticed him keenly that day again. He hasn't dressed up like everyday. It's not even a weekend. On the top of that he covered his face with some weird thing. If anyone rings the bell, he is answering without even opening the door. Even the maid has not come. He is only cleaning his home, washing his clothes and utensils. And at night, he was banging utensils in the balcony. What has happened to him?

I thought I will wait for him becoming normal again. I wished I could do something for him, but there are very few things I can do. I continued to wait. I waited all my life to find my love. Can't I wait a few more days to love him? So, I thought.

But his situation is becoming worse day by day. He is barely eating anything. He took to bed. I seldom see him now. 

And finally, he was carried out by a few people completely in White. I can't see their faces. What happened to him? I was screaming from the top of my voice to take me along. My love has not arrived after that. Our jar was forgotten in the home. I waited, waited but of no avail. I have also lost my smell.

The door opened after what I feel like ages. There is still a sliver of hope in me that my love came for me. It was blurry and I cannot see the person. As the person came close, I saw that it was the maid. I hate her, but the familiarity gave me some respite. She was cleaning the home and making it the way it was. But what is the home without love? It's like a coffee bean without caffeine. She came to us at the end. She opened the jar, shoveled us with a spoon and flushed us down the drain.
