# A few thoughts on Commodificiation
*This essay is originally written in Telugu. The following is an AI assisted English translation*

K. Balagopal, in his essays collected under [“Man and Marxism”](https://d-saikrishna.github.io/Essays/manishi-marxism.html), writes that one of the fundamental flaws of the capitalist system is commodification—the tendency of capitalism to turn everything into raw material for trade. Not only objects, but even values are converted into commodities, he argues.

However, Balagopal does not explicitly explain why this commodification is bad in those essays. That was not their purpose either. The essays begin from the premise that commodification is undesirable.

I began this essay by questioning how rational that premise is. The answers I arrived at to the questions I posed to myself form this essay.

## First Question: What exactly is the problem with commodification?

Why do I object to the commodification of certain “things” or values?

While thinking about this, I came across the fact that [puppies are now being rented out](https://www.mypet4rent.com/). This is something I once imagined as dystopian. But it exists today. Customers say it is very useful. Many people want to raise puppies, cuddle them, play with them—but cannot manage them everyday in longterm. In such cases, one can rent a puppy for a day or a week, enjoy its company, and return it. The website claims to have over a thousand puppies. Whenever one feels an urge for animal affection, one can play with a different breed.

Now imagine that tomorrow human babies are rented out in the same way. People experiencing “baby fever” rent infants for a week, play with them, and return them. Would we be comfortable with this form of commodification? I assume we would not.

### But why does it feel unacceptable?

Is it because we are not used to it? Or because we are losing certain values?

If the discomfort is merely due to habit, then it is not a very rational objection. I once read that hotels were initially mocked for “selling food.” Rice was considered sacred—annam parabrahma swaroopam—and selling it was seen as improper. But today we are fully accustomed to this commodification.

So merely saying “we are not used to it” is not a sufficient argument. Depending on conditions and technology, it is natural that certain goods are distributed through the market. Instead of treating commodification as a sin, it seems more reasonable to understand its problems concretely.

Let us then come to values. Humans are not born with fixed values, but societies do create them. Some values—like truth and honesty—are rational. Others are not necessarily so. “Food is divine,” for instance, may not feel entirely rational. Some values even appear as superstitions.

Today, the commodification of food does not disturb us much. In business logic, if a hotel accidentally cooks excess food, it may be considered less loss to throw it away than to distribute it to the hungry. In that logic, the value of “food is sacred” has been defeated. With such values, we can no longer ground our discomfort with commodification.

Can we then ground it in rational values?

Let us return to the example of children—human or animal. Why does renting a house feel acceptable, but renting a child does not? Is it because a child is alive? If so, then the value we lose through such commodification is life itself, and the physical and mental pain that life can experience. This value, I believe, is rational.

> My answer to the first question: I find commodification unacceptable when it leads to the loss of rational values.

[At this point, one could ask: “Isn’t the chicken–mutton trade also commodification? Doesn’t the value of life and pain apply there as well? If it does, shouldn’t we object to that commodification too?” This is precisely the vegan argument. I will take that up in another essay.]

## Second Question: What if commodification leads to a conflict of values?

If commodification clearly leads to the loss of a rational value, rejecting it is not difficult. Society has enough wisdom to do that, and by and large it has rejected such obvious forms.

The real problem arises when commodification causes the loss of some values while simultaneously bringing other values into visibility.

Take domestic work. Earlier, housework was not a market commodity. It was work imposed on women within the household. It had no fixed hours. In fact, we glorified this by saying it cannot be measured in time.

Today, in any city, domestic work is a purchasable service. There are separate rates for cleaning, cooking; different rates for daily work versus thrice-a-week work; salary cuts for absence; machines and mobile apps for housework. It is thoroughly commodified.

Through this commodification, previously unmeasurable domestic labour has gained some value and recognition.

Similarly, there is an argument that [surrogacy]((https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/cash-delivery)) recognizes and assigns value to the labour involved in pregnancy. Yet we are uncomfortable with surrogacy. The government has banned the selling of wombs, arguing that it erodes values like motherhood and bodily integrity.

Those who defend surrogacy counter that if women are making this decision freely, then free will itself is a major value. Both sides invoke rational values. Even though there is a serious question about whether poor women truly have freedom in these choices, surrogacy may still be one of the few opportunities available to them to earn money and escape poverty. Can we simply say that choosing this option is wrong?

Thus, commodification of surrogacy places us in a value dilemma. The same is true for prostitution, [selling blood](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30273994), or even [selling organs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_trade_in_Iran).

Both sides involve important, rational values. If people are freely selling their wombs, blood, or organs, banning the trade only pushes it underground—as we already know. If we dislike such commodification, then we must work to eliminate the conditions that force people into these choices in the first place. That is difficult. And those of us who lament the loss of values due to commodification must also take responsibility for this task.

Otherwise, we risk losing the other values. A discussion that begins with “commodification destroys values” cannot end merely with the destruction of values.

> My answer to the second question: When commodification leads to value conflicts, we must learn to balance those values. The problem is not commodification itself, but the tyranny of a single value that makes us stop thinking further.

## Finally…

I began this essay by asking how rational the premise “commodification is bad” really is. I do not think Balagopal makes a dogmatic claim that commodification is inherently evil. One line from his essay that I particularly like is:

**“To reconcile oneself with capitalism is to reconcile oneself with a life in which there are no values between human beings other than ‘utility’.”**

If commodification strips away all values except utility, then rejecting it is indeed rational. But we have also seen that new values can emerge—and that these values may even conflict with existing ones.

In such situations, however difficult it may be, we must move forward by balancing values, rather than choosing the easy authoritarian path.

Do we have the patience, consciousness, and sense of responsibility required to build and sustain such a balance?
