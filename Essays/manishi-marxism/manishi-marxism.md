Reading this book felt like undergoing a kind of political training. On the very first page of the very first essay, Balagopal poses a question: Are you happy when you look at the failures of twentieth-century socialism, or are you saddened by them? If you feel happy, then the rest of the essays in this book are not for you. If you feel saddened, you must read on.

Why should one feel saddened? Because a fully capitalist system is not entirely good for us—nor for other living beings. “But hasn’t capitalism eliminated more poverty than any other system?” you might ask in response. You should ask that question. Because it is true. Balagopal does not make the dogmatic argument that in order to change capitalism we must deny or ignore any good it has produced. One must accept the good that exists within it, while also understanding the harm. And to do that, we must think rationally, not through blind allegiance to any single ideology. That is the central message of these essays.

Balagopal carefully examines where Marxism helps us understand what is wrong with capitalism. He credits Marxism for its sharp economic analysis of capitalist exploitation of labour, commodification, and related processes. But he does not stop there. He also critiques capitalism from environmental and existential perspectives, bringing out further harmful features. One critique I particularly liked is this line: “Capitalism presents the world as though it were a plate of food.” It struck me that many of the problems we experience today can be examined through this single sentence. Reckless pollution and destruction—carried out as if tomorrow does not exist—are captured perfectly here. Another line that stayed with me is: “Coming to terms with capitalism means coming to terms with a life in which ‘utility’ is the only value left in human relationships.”

However, the primary aim of these essays is not merely to expose what Marxism can reveal about the evils of capitalism, but to examine the flaws within Marxism’s own ideas about building a new, egalitarian society. I felt this examination was done with remarkable depth and honesty.

Marxists often claim that Marxism is a science. Practitioners of homeopathy also claim their system is a science. Religious fundamentalists argue that their scriptures are perfect, and that it is human beings who fail to practise them properly. When questioned, they respond, “First read our texts—otherwise your criticism is invalid.” This argument is fundamentally flawed. From a scientific standpoint, the burden of proof lies with those who claim that a theory is scientific. Even so, thinkers like Balagopal and M. N. Roy declared Marxism to be unscientific only after immersing themselves deeply in it. Yet they did not reject it wholesale. They separated what was rational in Marxism from what was not, and examined both carefully. I find nothing problematic in this approach.

Marxism, in fact, has much to learn from other scientific disciplines. Balagopal repeatedly argues that Marxism must learn from psychology. Although a Marxist like Erich Fromm initiated such thinking, it was never seriously taken up by most Marxists. In his own critique, Balagopal points out that several situations predicted by Marxism did not unfold in a “straight line.” When an event has two or three contributing factors, identifying the real cause is not easy—it requires rational rigor. Marxism, he argues, too quickly concludes that material conditions are the sole cause behind many phenomena. This critique closely resembles arguments from statistics: non-linearity, causality, and the familiar warning that “correlation is not causation.” Reading this, my curiosity grew—as a student of statistics myself. And then I discovered that Balagopal had done his PhD in Advanced Probability and his post-doctorate at the Indian Statistical Institute!

To conclude, building an egalitarian society is the responsibility of all of us. The answer does not lie within the grasp of any single ideology, nor within any single class. As Balagopal puts it: “In the end, human beings will aspire for an egalitarian society not as workers, not as Adivasis, not as women, not as Dalits—but as conscious individuals.”
