# Commodification of Air

A human breathes about 15 kg of air per day. The total amount of air in the world in the lowest 2 meters of the atmosphere is approximately 1.25 quadrillion kilograms (1.25 * 1015 kg) and it is replenished everyday by photosynthesis (O2), outgassing (N2) and several other processes. Even if we consider that the human population would reach 10 Billions, each human would still have 1.25 * 105 kg of air to breathe. That is ~8000 times what an average human needs. There should be no shortage of air for any human. Or for any living thing.

Air is thus classified as a public good. It qualifies both defining characteristics of a public good.

Non-excludable: It is costly or impossible to exclude anyone from breathing air.
Non-rival: When one person uses the public good, it doesn’t affect availability for another, given the immense supply.

However, the high rates of air pollution made us purchase air purifiers. Every household purchasing an air purifier is converting clean air into a private good (excludable + rival). If the promise of technologies like [liquid trees](https://www.newsweek.com/viral-post-liquid-tree-algae-carbon-dioxide-1792214) are realised, air would become a club good (excludable+non-rival) in the gated societies.

Air is basically being commodified.

## What is commodification?
Commodification is the process of converting goods and services into a commodity that can be traded in a market. Private goods — cars, pizzas, houses — are commodities and the supply-demand dynamics would determine its price in a market economy. One of the critiques of neo-liberal economy is that it commodifies public goods and even objects that are generally outside the realm of market. This commodification is encouraged because it creates new markets and new avenues of investments. For instance, think about the growth in the app-based dating market. Dating was outside the realm of the market until a decade ago, but is now successfully commodified.

One may ask, *what is the problem with such commodification?* Commodification of Dating created jobs and profits. It has certainly helped hundreds of people in finding love. But a question remains: where can we draw the line of commodification? Commodification of dating is fine. Can we commodify love next?

One of the problems with commodification is that it reduces the value of the commodity to the price attached to it by the market. When the said object was provided in non-market ways, there were other societal-ethical-ecological values at play. The market provision exhausts all such values and puts singular focus on price of the commodity. For example, children are not commodified yet ([Not pets](https://www.mypet4rent.com/)). Children are provided for in a non-market way where it deals with values like love, responsibility, care, sacrifice, etc. A neo-liberal market can commodify this by putting children on sale or rent, thereby satisfying the baby-fever in many childless adults, permanently or temporarily. Any discomfort in reading the above example is the visceral understanding of the stated problem of commodification. Many more such examples are discussed by Michael Sandel in his book What Money Can’t Buy: [The Moral Limits of Market.](https://sandel.scholars.harvard.edu/publications/what-money-cant-buy-moral-limits-markets)

## Why should air not be commodified?
The argument for clean air not to be commodified also arises from values. John Rawls’ thought-experiment Veil of Ignorance can be applied to illuminate them. If you were to choose between commodifying air or not, before knowing in which family you’d be born in, what would you choose? [50% of world owns less than 2% of global wealth](https://peoplesdispatch.org/2025/12/18/half-of-the-worlds-population-owns-just-2-of-global-wealth-un-report-finds/) and there is more chance that you’d be born in one of those families than in the top 10%. Commodified air would mean you’d have to buy it from the market from your meagre income and forgo breathing clean air when your family’s breadwinner falls sick. What about animals that cannot participate in the market? Commodification of air is to under-value life that cannot participate in a market.

Fairness is another value. Clean air has been a public good for all for the greater part of human history, until polluters began polluting it. Given the nature of the economic system, [high polluters have higher income](https://science.thewire.in/environment/india-carbon-emissions-rich-poor-households/). And so high polluters, who changed the nature of clean air from being a public good, will only have access to clean air as a commodity. Sounds unfair? In the language of economics, polluters haven’t paid the negative externalities.

Commodification also changes the relationship between nature and humans into that of seller and buyer. If clean air is bought as a private commodity, paid for by money, will it place any moral limit on the buyer to not emit? The buyers of clean air commodities can continue to pollute the common air. The value of shared humanity and collective responsibility would find itself gasping in the clean air bubbles.

One could argue that we could tax the polluters (paying-up the negative externality) to subsidise the purchase of clean air commodities by everyone. I’d speculate that it is more efficient and effective for society to collectively preserve clean air than to purchase it as a commodity for all.

## Should you not buy the air purifier?

The point of this essay is not to put the systemic guilt on the individual. We should all surely purchase masks and air-purifiers to protect ourselves and our families, if we have the wherewithal. Commodification places an illusory veil on the commodity and covers-up all the values and social realities underneath. This essay attempts to uncover those values. If we feel these values sound rational and are what makes us human, we should treat these commodities as band-aids at the best and take action towards re-establishing clean air as a public good.
