I didn’t expect four essays, just 28 pages, to provoke this much thought.

They explain beautifully how human civilisation has seen highs and lows because of the conflict between science and superstition. This conflict begins first in the mind of the scientist. Very few scientists have been able to resist this inner contradiction, and the book illustrates those rare examples effectively.

They clearly show—using examples from health and sericulture—how the caste system and obsessive ideas of “pollution” prevented Indian society from practicing science. In Western countries, a great deal of scientific work happened in the sphere of production, aimed at achieving more output at lower cost. In India, however, the castes traditionally involved in production were kept away from education for generations. Even today, scientific advancement in these productive sectors remains limited. China and Korea have surged far ahead.

At the same time, Bala Gopal argues that because capitalists pursue science mainly for productivity, we have started viewing science in a narrow way. As a result, science has been fragmented. People learn and teach only the knowledge required for a particular industry. Wherever there is more money, more people flock to that branch of knowledge—just like the IT craze in India. Other subjects then seem unnecessary. Even scientific temper itself becomes irrelevant. That is why, he argues, a person can be highly knowledgeable in one scientific field and still hold superstitions in other areas.

Not only that—science pursued by capitalists for productivity becomes ahistorical, he says. This felt absolutely true. Do IT courses teach the history of IT anywhere? Do they explain how IT emerged, or what problems it was originally meant to solve? None of this is discussed. In this sense, science has become stripped of its history.

According to him, it is popular science books that have brought back some sense of wholeness and history to science. I really liked this analysis. I never saw science as fragmented knowledge; even while working in IT, I felt it was possible to understand space science and biology. I discovered this sense of integration through Carl Sagan’s books. From scientists’ biographies and books on the history of science, I learned about the roots of many disciplines.

But is it wrong for capitalists to do science? It didn’t seem entirely wrong to me. Those who invest for profit will naturally influence science. That’s exactly what R&D departments do today. In fact, private companies in our country already spend very little on R&D.

Doing science for profit isn’t wrong—as long as it causes no harm. But what about doing it for power? This aspect is sharply analysed through the Marxist concept of ideology. When capitalists engage in politics alongside business, they turn their science into ideology and make it unquestionable. At that point, debate around that science disappears. There is no balancing of good and bad. Superstition spreads disguised as science and enslaves people to it. This argument felt extremely relevant to today’s AI-driven society. AI knowledge is turning into ideology. Many scientists have been writing about this recently.

The final essay discusses how poorly we teach mathematics to children. It felt like something parents and teachers should definitely read. We need to remove children’s fear of numbers.
