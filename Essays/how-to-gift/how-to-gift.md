# How to gift?
*This essay is originally written in Telugu. The following is an AI assisted English translation*

I am terrible at giving gifts. For my friends’ birthdays, for Secret Santa—just the thought of buying gifts makes me anxious. Some good friends kindly decide the gift themselves and ask me for my share of the money. It’s because of such good people that I still feel I have friends at all.

But you can’t depend on someone else every single time, right? Many times I’ve had to think and buy gifts on my own. Every time, it’s a trial by fire. “What should I give? What should I give?” I pester my friends to death. I don’t like what they suggest. After giving two or three ideas, even they get irritated and say, “Go die your own death,” and abandon me. I scour the entire internet and finally end up buying something. These days, AI helps a bit too.

Still, I don’t like this constant last-minute thinking and gift-buying. It feels like I can never pick the best gift this way. With the overthinking I’m blessed with, I need to come up with a theory for this. That’s what I’m attempting in this essay. If it helps you too, I’ll be happy.

To be honest, I’ve used pointless arguments before to avoid giving gifts altogether. That was just me covering up my inability to buy one. I’ll put that argument aside now. A gift is something you give without expecting anything in return. The moment you expect something back, it becomes a transaction. So a gift is something given purely for the other person’s happiness and growth, with no expectations. That definition is enough.
(Which also means we shouldn’t expect gifts on our own birthdays!)

## There are two problems here:
The first problem: knowing what gives the other person happiness, and what contributes to their growth. If you know your friends well, this may not be a big issue. But if you overthink like I do, this becomes a huge problem. We wonder whether what we think will make them happy might not actually help their growth. And if we give something that’s only “useful,” we worry they might not like it and may never use it. By the time we stop thinking and make a decision, the birthday is already over.

The second problem: figuring out whether they already own it. This is crucial. Once, an office friend gave me a book as a Secret Santa gift. While handing it over, he even said, “I am sure you will like it.” I excitedly tore open the cover—only to find a book I had read the previous month and even written about on my social media. Shouldn’t this idiot have done at least that much research before buying me a gift? I’m always afraid I might make the same mistake.

## So what do we do?
First, we need clarity. What matters more: that the friend likes the gift, or that it helps their growth? We need an answer to this question. For me, usefulness matters more. That single decision eliminates more than half the gift options.

Recently, when buying a gift for my friend’s two-year-old daughter’s birthday, everyone suggested toys and clothes. I spent a lot of time roaming shops and the internet. I didn’t like anything. None of it felt useful for the child’s development. I even scolded myself—“If you want to help a two-year-old’s growth, give her cereal, man!” But obviously her mother would do that (second problem again!). Anyway, I decided firmly that I would give something useful and stayed away from clothes and toys. I started thinking about what could actually help. From among useful things, choosing something the child would like felt easier.

Deciding what’s useful is also relatively simple. Based on a friend’s job, hobbies, and aspirations, we can shortlist options. From those, pick something within budget and something they’ll like—that’s enough.

Now you might ask, “What job, hobby, or aspiration does a two-year-old have?” True, she doesn’t have those. But these days children (you too!) are glued to phones, right? To reduce that, I found a gift called a busy board. It has switches, LED lights, wires—things to keep children busy without screens. They said it improves hand–mind coordination too. Plus, it was colorful and looked appealing to kids. I bought it immediately. The last time I asked, her mother said the child uses it quite well. Let’s see how it goes.

# Now let’s use everything we’ve learned

Is it some friend’s birthday? Not necessary. Now let’s buy a gift—for ourselves. When was the last time you bought yourself a gift? Not something for your needs, but something that helps your growth and gives you joy. Buy that now.

I bought myself an LED book light. I love reading. I often felt like reading while walking in parks in the evening, but poor lighting made it impossible. Now I can clip this LED light to my book. I can read while traveling on a bus at night. I can read anywhere.
