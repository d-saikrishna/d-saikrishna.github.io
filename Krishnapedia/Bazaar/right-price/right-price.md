# Paying the right price
What if I say that your lifestyle has been subsided by the poor?

When we talk about subsidies, our mental image is often the rich paying for the poor because the latter cannot afford them.

But what if I say that even the poor subsidize the rich?

Subsidy is when you don’t pay the full price of a commodity. But what decides the price?

Costs. Rents, Labor costs, Profits etc., determine the price of a commodity.

Often, all costs are not accounted for.

And when we don’t account for any particular cost, the price can be reduced.

A cigarette costs the health of the society. This cost is often unaccounted. So we tax it to increase its price to match its true costs.

These unaccounted costs are called negative externalities.

Other commodities we use also have external costs.

The timber for your sofa set was sourced from the Global South where the price of timber is so low compared to its actual cost on society. Deforestation leads to floods, it degrades their soil, it affects their live-stock, and depletes ground-water.

The private loggers corrupt governments here to make them unaccount for these costs of deforestation on society. As a result they obtain timber for a cheap price, which they sell to us.

The metal for our laptops, leather for our belts, fuel for your vehicles are all sourced this way.

The poor have been subsidising our lifestyles because of bad policies.

If you find anyone complaining about subsidising food or vaccines for the poor, please remind them how they have been living off the poor. These subsidies are the symptoms of the missing taxes.

And you need not be a socialist or a Marxist to support these taxes. It’s plain justice – paying the right price.
