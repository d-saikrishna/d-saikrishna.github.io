# Biases that make us bad thinkers

Bias (పక్షపాతం) is basically an opinion formed on the basis of a very small sample size. Since humans cannot survey the entire population, we all have biases. The best we can do is be conscious of them. Why?

1. **Being biased can hurt others**. Because you won't give the other homes, jobs etc., based on your prejudicial opinion.
2. **Being biased can hurt you as well**. Because you might give your home, job etc., to an undeserving candidate based on your beneficial opinion.

There are a lot of biases. I will document only those which I have become conscious of.

1. **Confirmation Bias**: I found myself doing this when I used to be a keyboard warrior. In the urge to give a quick comeback in an internet debate, I used to find information that strengthens my opinion and post it. Internet debates exacerbate this bias in me. So, I try to stay away from them.

2. [**Survivorship Bias**](https://d-saikrishna.github.io/Blogs/Anviksiki/survivorship-bias.html): I used to you believe that old movies are better. This is Survivorship bias. Only good movies from old times survive. But I compare them with both good and bad movies of today. Obviously old ones fare better. I wrote more about this here.

3. **Groupthink**: We all are tribal at some level. There were times when I accepted group's opinions on a lot of topics as mine without questioning. Now I might act so to avoid drama, but mostly have my own opinions.

4. **Anchoring Bias**: I cling to the first news I read and an opinion is formed. Even if there is contrary news coming later, I give more weight to the first piece of news. It takes sometime for me to equally weigh the new piece of information with the old.

5. **Halo effect**: I like an actor because he acts well. I carry forward this fondness to all other facets of life. I found myself defending him for his problematic statements. This is also the reason why people say "*You should never meet your heroes*"

I'll update this as I discover more in me.

**Update**

I discovered Rolf Dobelli's "Art of Thinking Clearly" a wonderful compendium of all thinking errors we commit.  There are three major ways to reason these thinking errors:
1. Evolutionary biology
2. Psychology and cognitive science
3. Statistics and humans' general challenge with numbers

I don’t think the errors due to our biological evolution can be solved. We cannot compete with what evolution gave us. It’s best to recognize our primal instincts whenever they appear and refrain from making any decisions at those times. Cognitive errors could be managed by managing our environment. The challenge with numbers and statistics can be solved with some training.
