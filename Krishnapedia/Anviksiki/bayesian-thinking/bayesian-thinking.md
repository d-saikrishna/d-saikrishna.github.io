# Bayesian thinking for a better world

People have all kinds of biases and superstitions.

Many believe that men are better at work than women. Some believe that horoscopes are 100% true. A few believe that Gandhiji was a vicious person. What not.

On the outset, I am not against such prior opinions. My concern is more with why we refuse to change our opinions despite having new evidence? Why do we have these cognitive blocks that make us bad thinkers?

Here’s a small math story to explore this.

Say my friend opines that women are bad at work. I asked a number to his belief – “Out of 10 female employees, how many do you think are bad?”. He quipped, “8”. He feels 80% of women are bad employees. Such opinions perpetuate the gender pay gap.

We agreed that an efficient employee would do the same task in 5 hours, while a bad employee takes 7 hours, on an average. We also assumed a standard deviation of 1 hour for both.

I then provided my friend with new evidence. I told him about my female colleague who would do the job in 4 hours!

In the light of this new evidence, will his prior opinion on women change? Ideally, it has to. That ideal case is called Bayesian Updating.

Given our assumptions, there is a 24% chance of finding my colleague in the lot of good employees. Obviously, within the bad lot of employees, there is a minute( 0.4%) chance of finding such gems.

The Bayesian Updating would go this way: Posterior = Prior * Likelihood of new evidence. So my friend’s updated opinion should be that only 6.25% of women are bad employees! [80% * 0.004/(80%*0.004 + 20%*0.24) ]

One update and such a drastic change in the opinion.

Ofcourse, neither this updated opinion is completely true. Not all female employees can be stars like my colleague.

But as my friend continues to update his opinions based on new female employees he encounters, he would reach an opinion that there is no big difference between men and women when it comes to work. And so, he would champion equal pay for equal work.

Such an ideal world is indeed possible. For that, we have to become Bayesian thinkers. Otherwise, our entrenched biases and superstitions will rule the roost.
