# Decision Baits

“ Which vaccine is better? ”  my friend asked me.

“I don’t know which vaccine is better, but I’ll take COVAXIN because PM Modi has taken it”, I answered. 

Then I realised how I’d “baited and switched” the actual question. It basically means that whenever we are posed with a hard question, we use an easier question as a bait and switch to answering that.

Deciding what vaccine to choose is hard. So I answered an easier question of what vaccine did PM Modi take.

This could be both good and bad.

Good because it helps leaders to persuade masses. Most of our opinions are not our opinions but the opinions of the leaders we follow. Their opinions are our baits to important questions.

Bad because our baits could be wrong. Our leaders might not hold the right beliefs. The baits might not proxy our actual questions accurately.

And we end up answering bad questions.

This can become disastrous.

If you switch “What’s good for my child?” to “What’s Sharma ji’s child doing?” (which is easier to see and answer) – it will be disastrous to your child.

Baits are essential heuristics because we cannot develop deep knowledge on every subject. My baits in issues of economy are economists like Raghuram Rajan, Jean Dreze. A CEO would decide on tech-strategy using CTO’s opinion as a bait.

But the least we can do is to select baits carefully. Let that be your original decision at least. Don’t switch “is she a good leader?” into a bait “How many people follow her?”

Invest some time in selecting baits, and your future decisions will be smoother and effective.
