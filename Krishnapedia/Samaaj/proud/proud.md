# Being proud of our communities
[October 6, 2024]

To be or not to be proud of our communities? Especially of the communities we are born into.
The castes, religions, nationalities, etc.

Being proud does serve a purpose. It gives us a identity. It gives us brothers to cooperate with. It satisfies a lot of tribal instincts.

But it's not that great to be proud of the communities we are born into. These are mere accidents. We could well be born in another community, a community that we hate.

It's not that great also because almost everyone is proud of the communities they are born into. They are either brainwashed or develop the pride as a survival mechanism. It is easier to live with a community sharing the common pride about the community. An Afghan Taliban is also proud of the community he is born into. And so is every fundamentalist bigot. It's not that great.

What is great then?

It is great to step beyond the communities we are born into and be part of new communities. To create new communities if none of the existing communities are of our liking. To be proud of our communities, not just because we were born in it, but because of what they do. To develop our pride on such objective basis. That is great.

I try to do this. I'm proud of a few communities I chose to participate in. 
1. **[Hyderabad Write Club](https://www.instagram.com/writeclubhyd?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==)**: I'm proud of it because we* write stories and help people write stories. Many people wrote their first stories on our prompts. I discovered the writer in me here. It's a therapeutic exercise. Many found friends.
2. **[Paata Telugu Pustakalu](https://www.instagram.com/paathatelugupusthakaalu?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==)**: I'm proud of it we* read old Telugu books. We discovered great authors who had a lot to say and educate. We help each other comprehend the language, which is not being taught well now.
3. **[FOSS-United](https://fossunited.org/)**: I'm proud of it because we* spread awareness on open-source software, hardware, open-science, open-data etc.
4. **[Takshashila Institution](https://takshashila.org.in/)**: I'm proud if it we* try to educate citizenry and get them interested in public policies and on thinking rationally about them.

**I used "we" liberally. My participation is on a spectrum, sometimes limited to just participation on Whatsapp chats. But, yes, still proud that I chose to be part of that group :)*
