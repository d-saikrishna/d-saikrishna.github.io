# Gutenburg's impact

**“IMPACT”** is not a common word in the Engineering colleges. During my placement sessions, there were hardly any companies hiring for the impact sector. That made me question the Engineering stream to pursue a career in Impact. I was wrong. 

In the medieval era, knowledge was hoarded. Only those who had access to manuscripts could interpret texts. And as Michael Foucault said, **“Knowledge is Power”**. So, the clergy and the rulers could exert power over the masses using their privileged knowledge.

Then came an Engineer named Johann Gutenberg. He developed a printing press that revolutionised printing in Europe. The Bible was printed and distributed widely. People like Martin Luther questioned, *“If everyone can now get to read a Bible by themselves, why need a priest?”*

Answering the above question had other effects on society. It developed individualism and revived iconoclasm. Eventually, it led to the death of feudalism, serfdom and the rise of capitalism. The world began to change. 

Gutenberg had no clue of the impact he had made.

The irony is that his initial clients were the clergy who wanted to print Bibles to spread and uniformize Christianity.

That’s the story of many Engineers. They prepare the background for later revolutions to take place. Be it the one by Martin Luther or the Industrial Revolution. 

But I would like to pose a question.

If Gutenberg could be so impactful even without planning to be, how much more impactful can a conscious modern Engineer be? Immense, isn’t it?

Happy EngineersDay.
