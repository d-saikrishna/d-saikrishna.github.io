# Aryabhatta would be crying

India has a great cultural heritage. Intellectual heritage, religious heritage, philosophical heritage are all subsets of it. 

One of our weird habits is to mix up all these things. We mix up our intellectual heritage with our unfortunate heritage of pseudoscience/superstitions and then validate superstitions today using our past intellectual heritage. This I feel is a grave dishonour to scientists and mathematicians of Indian past. So, in this blog, I will try to draw a **THICK** line between our intellectual heritage of Astronomy and superstition of Astrology.

Aryabhatta, the mathematician-astronomer of ancient India made wonderful discoveries about the space and universe. He wrote Aryabhatiya, the astronomical treatise which consisted of four parts (Padas):
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="astronomy-astrology/ARYABHATIYAM.png" width="100%"/></div>
(I may have erred in correctly placing the notable work in the relevant Pada)

If you go through the table again, you'll observe one thing. **Aryabhatta did not write that planetary positions will affect your health, marriage and career.** He was not an astrologer. 

You would find people saying "just because few astrologers are wrong astrology is not wrong." For the hypothesis of astrology to be valid, we need proofs. No one proved the hypothesis of astrology the way Aryabhatta proved his hypothesis of Astronomy.

It is also possible that Aryabhatta committed errors in his proofs. He was a human after all. These errors would be rectified by the later scientists. No sensible person would dare say that Aryabhatta was not an astronomer because of any errors in his works. Because he approached his work with reason. The reason which is missing in Astrology.

It is disrespecting Aryabhatta to use his works to say astrology is science. Aryabhatta himself was against the theological astrology. He proved that eclipses are not because of Rahu, Ketu but because of shadows cast by Earth and Moon. Aryabhatta was even criticised for doing this (like how rationalists today are being called anti-national). Al-Biruni, an Iranian scholar of 10-11th Century, wrote about how Aryabhatta was unreasonably criticised and considered him a heterodox. Aryabhatta would be crying to see that his works on Calendar are later reduced to superstitions of Panchangam like Muhurtam (auspicious and inauspicious time)

Our rejection of superstitions should not be based on the birthplace of those superstitions. Nevertheless, if you are finding it hard to reject astrology because it is 'Indian', [Swami Vivekananda has something to tell](https://english.sreyas.in/man-the-maker-of-his-destiny/).  


> *I think the Greeks first took astrology to India and took from the Hindus the science of astronomy and carried it back with them from Europe. Because in India you will find old altars made according to a certain geometrical plan, and certain things had to be done when the stars were in certain positions, therefore I think the Greeks gave the Hindus astrology, and the Hindus gave them astronomy*

If you are still telling yourself that astrology is science. Swami Vivekananda has this advice for you.


> *You will find that astrology and all these mystical things are generally signs of a weak mind; therefore as soon as they are becoming prominent in our minds, we should see a physician, take good food and rest*

This is the land that produced great minds like Aryabhatta along with other superstitious minds that fear a shadow and spread superstitions. If I have to take pride in my country's past, I will take pride in the works of Aryabhatta. If you seek pride from astrologers, **you need a doctor. A real one.**
