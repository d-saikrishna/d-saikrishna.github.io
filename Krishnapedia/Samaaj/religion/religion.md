# Religion

In one of the Anvikshiki blogs, I wrote about the [distinction between Arts and Sciences](https://d-saikrishna.github.io/Blogs/Anviksiki/art-science.html). Art and Science, both have a function in the society. I don’t disrespect one for other. They are two strong forces.

But I want these forces to be used for our collective wellbeing.

As per the definition of Art, it evokes emotions in people. The nine emotions - Navarasa

I want to evoke and be evoked of positive emotions of Love, Adbhuta, Shanta, Hasya, Veera, Karuna and Shanta.

Not the negative emotions of Raudra (anger), Bibhatsa (disgust) and Bhayanaka (fear). 

A good artist uses even these negative emotions to eventually make the audience experience the positive emotions (Anubhava)

For the sake of an argument, please let me consider Religion as an Art for now.

Because it can also evoke strong emotions in people. That’s the power of it.

And we all are artists of this Art.

All I hope is it is used by us to evoke positive emotions.

For collective wellbeing.

That is religion for me. Beyond the personal, I want my religion to work as a unifying force; to build empathy and solidarity; to fill me with positive emotions - not hatred and disgust.
