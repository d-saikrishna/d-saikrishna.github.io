Can you grow Kashmiri Apples in Hyderabad?

You can use the same seeds/grafts as in Kashmir. You can create similar weather conditions in a lab and use the same fertiliser, pesticide etc. 

Still you won’t be able to grow an apple that is as juicy and sweet as a Kashmiri apple.

Why?

One reason given in the book “Entangled life” is soil. More technically, it is the fungi in soil.  Different fungi provides different aroma, color, taste, etc., to fruits. And it is hard to replicate this exact fungal composition elsewhere. 

I’ll try to tease out a life lesson from this biology story.

We try to mimic successful people by following their habits, decisions, methods and routines. Often they may not work for us and we crib about it. Maybe we can think about soil here? 

Do we have the same soil for their methods to give identical results? If not, there is no point in copying them. Our soil will grow something unique that theirs cannot grow. We just have to find our unique fruit.
