# Ode to Popular Science Books
In his essays on Science, Balagopal argued that science today lacks both integrity and history.

**Integrity**: He argued that knowledge is broken and boxed today. As productivity became the only motive to do science, it pushed science in the direction of ever-increasing specialization. Productivity-seeking is not wrong, but it has consequences. A scientist would be an expert in one field but would hold superstitious ideas in others. In the essay “Value of Science”, Richard Feynman wrote “a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy.” Balagopal would rephrase it as: “a scientist looking at problems outside their field is just as dumb as the next guy.”

**History**: Every scientific advancement is a response to some human problem. Solving one problem only led to another. Balagopal argued that there is little incentive to learn and teach this history when schools and colleges are viewed just as factories manufacturing labor for industry. For example, we were useful to the IT industry when we just knew how to code. The history of Information theory is not so useful. Thus, even Computer Science students rarely learn about that.

Balagopal hoped that popular science books would help fill these gaps. They would connect different branches of science and tell their histories. Carl Sagan’s books fulfilled this role for me. His books made me curious about science and helped me see it as not just a livelihood opportunity. What are your favourite popular science books?
