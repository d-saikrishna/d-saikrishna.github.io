Are we really doing what we want to do? This story taught me to take free will a bit lightly.

Cordyceps is a fungi that attacks ants. It can completely hijack the ant behavior. It makes the ant climb a tree where there is good sunlight and die there. Then, from the ants body, the fungi blooms into a mushroom. The mushroom spores will then find a new ant and the cycle repeats. 

While this is an extreme example, it teaches one thing. A lot of what we want to do is a result of chemical composition in our bodies. We need not be too egoistic about it.
