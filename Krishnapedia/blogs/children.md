# “How are children born?”

I’m sure each of us asked this question as a child. And we received some innocent response from our parents. The most famous being: God sends children

Now we are adults and know how children are born. But rewind to a period when human civilisation had no answer to that question.

Humans are not great at finding cause of any thing, including cause of children.

There is months gap between sex and pregnancy. And in that gap, a lot of things could’ve happened: the woman ate a fruit, a fish bit her leg when she bathed in a lake, she ate some grass, etc.

And a simple human would get confused. How did the woman become pregnant? He looks back to see a lot of probable reasons: fruit, grass, fish bite, etc etc.

In that confusion, we developed all kind of superstitions. We could be bad at finding cause. But we are great at telling stories!

This book, Pelli daani puttu porvathralu, has many such stories related to marriage and its origins. Give it a try!
