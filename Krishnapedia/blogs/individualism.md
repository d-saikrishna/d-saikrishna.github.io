I was on a heritage walk, hosted by Sohail Hashmi, at Humayun’s Tomb in Delhi. The architects of the tomb were from Persia and they designed predominantly a persian architecture for the tomb. But the labour who built the tomb were Indian. While they built the magnificent tomb as per the diktat, they had shown their values in the most subtle forms possible. You’ll see Indianness (elephants, elements of Hindu culture etc.,) on the stonework, while the stones together build a persian style mausoleum.

This was medieval India under feudalism. The labour would probably be killed for taking the creative liberty. And still, they expressed individualism.

Human beings are definitely social beings. They are part of a group and the wellbeing of the group determines the wellbeing of the individual. But I don’t think that calls for dissolution of the individual. It should be like a fruit salad, where each fruit can distinctly be identified. Not a fruit juice that dissolves everything. Salads are healthier than juices.
