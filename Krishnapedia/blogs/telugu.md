I came across these facts about Telugu language in a book “Sajeeva Sampradayamga Vemana”, by Sa Vem Ramesh. In this book, he explained the beauty of Telugu this way:

1. **⁠Ajantham**: Words in telugu end with vowels. We call our Gods Rama and Krishna, instead of Ram and Krishn. For this reason, it is said that Niccolò de' Conti called Telugu as the “Italian of the East”
2. **⁠Vowel Harmony**: One vowel of a word attracts another vowel, especially in the form of Sandhis. It makes pronunciation easier.
3. ⁠Phonetically, there are as many vowels (if not more) as there are consonants in a word, making it a sweet singable language.
