# What is Literature?

I came across a definition of literature in a course taught by Prof. Chintakindi Kasim. English definition of that definition would be:
`
Literature is the presentation of natural truths in a beautiful way. 
`

The focus is on two words here: *truth* and *beautiful*

In the book "Entangled Life", I found an example that illustrates this definition well. It is the story of Ninkasi.

About 4000 years ago, people of Mesopotamia (~Iraq) discovered the magic of brewing beer. The liquid made them high. Failing to reason it out, they did the obvious- they created a goddess out if it: Ninkasi, the goddess of beer and brewing.

Naturally, they also wrote a lot of stories and hymns in her praise. One such hymn is the “Hymn to Ninkasi”, which contains the world’s first recipe of brewing Beer.

Beautiful, so that the truth is not boring and gets passed on. 

The truth of beer brewing could’ve been a boring recipe manual. But, would I write about it then? 😛

We humans can make anything spiritual. Including Beers.

🍻 Glory to Ninkasi 🍻
