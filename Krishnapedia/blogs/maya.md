# Maya

I was at a wedding and a friend asked me how I see ritualistic wedding games. It reminded me of this sketch from Devdutt Pattanaik’s “My Gita”.

Maya is the human ability to give value to things & actions. Gold prices increased? It’s because of our Maya. What is the use of that metal otherwise, that we want to hoard it?

Without maya, football is a silly act of kicking a ball. Without maya, dance is just jumping; Music becomes noise.

For an absurdist, it is maya that brings meaning in otherwise meaningless life.

Caution: Everyone has their own maya/meaning. It’s suffocating to live in other’s maya. I get depressed when I get forced to an EDM concert, but enjoy Teenmaars.
