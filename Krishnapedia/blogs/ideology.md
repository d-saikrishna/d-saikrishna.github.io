# Reject all ideologies

I used the word "ideology" loosely before. 

But after learning how Karl Marx defined this word, I came to a conclusion that all ideologies are wrong. Ideology itself is wrong.

In simple words, this is what I understood from Marx's definition of ideology:
```
Ideology is a set of beliefs and ideas in a society that serve the interests and privileges of the powerful class
```

Now these beliefs/ideas need not be true. But they can still serve some group of people just because this idea is prevalent. Just because you believe in it. Make a tiny list of your beliefs and think who are getting benefited out of it, even if the belief is false.

Let me give an example. The idea that "AI is inevitable" seems like an ideology, not a fact. But if this idea becomes prevalent, there is a group of people who would get benefited out of it. And they will thus try to make this idea prevalent, even if this idea is false. [The Myth of Inevitability of AI](https://leonfurze.com/2025/04/28/the-myth-of-inevitable-ai/)

Marx thus called ideology as "false consciousness". But when his ideas became an ideology (Marxism), he said he was not a Marxist himself :)

The alternative to ideology is truth. Satyameva Jayate!
