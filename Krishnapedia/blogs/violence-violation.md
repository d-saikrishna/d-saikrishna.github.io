# Violence vs Violation
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="blogs/violence-violation.jpg" width="80%"/></div>

Devdutt Pattanaik explains ‘violence’ vs ‘violation’ in “My Gita” using the story of Gajendra Moksha.

Violence occurs in nature for food and survival. Like the crocodile that bites. This violence is not ‘adharma’. The crocodile is not a villain. 

Violation is dominating others to satisfy our egos. We also feel violated when these egos are hurt—like the proud elephant in the story.

Knowing the difference between ‘violence’ and ‘violation’ is important. Otherwise we would punish a rapist and the woman killing him in self-defence the same way.

Try to think existing world conflicts with this. Israel-Palestine; Ukraine-Russia; India-Pakistan etc. 

Who is doing violence (self-defence, survival)? Who is doing violation? (Ego, power mongering)
