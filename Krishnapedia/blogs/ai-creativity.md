Knowing how AI works might help us forecast this question.

Simply put, AI needs data to train upon. ChatGPT got trained on studio ghibli images to generate more such images. 

But those studio ghibli images were only the final output. Where is the data on mental processes of the artists who created those images in the first place? 

That data is not available. AI is not trained on that, yet. Till then, AI can mimic human art, but I don’t think it can replace human art.

Moreover, humans enjoy doing art. Can these machines enjoy? 🙂

I wrote a related article on it, which goes a little more technical: [Will an AI joke land](https://saikrishnadammalapati.medium.com/will-an-ai-joke-land-5117bc053fa5)

This line from the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets also stuck with me.

The diary in context is a dark-magical one that writes back to people writing in it. Much alike the LLM Chatbots today. Ginny uses it so much that she looses her freewill to it.

Where are the brains of LLMs? Who owns it? Hope not a Voldemort? 🧟
