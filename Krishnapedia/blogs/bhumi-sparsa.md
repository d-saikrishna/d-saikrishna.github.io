I found this sculpture of Buddha in Bhumi Sparsa Mudra in the last cave of Ajanta. The story behind it very much about us. Here is how it goes:

Buddha was meditating under the Bodhi Tree. Demon Mara wanted to distract Buddha to stop him from attaining enlightenment. He sent his demons to frighten (top left) and daughters to tempt (bottom) Buddha out of meditation. 

Having failed to distract Buddha, Mara challenged Buddha's enlightenment by asking for witness. 

That's when Buddha touched the Earth with his right hand (Bhumi sparsha), asking mother earth to bear witness to his enlightenment. It is believed that mother earth roared to declare being witness to the enlightenment of Buddha. 

Now how does it relate to us? 

We live in an attention economy. Our eye-balls are being competed for by a multitude of apps, e-commerce sites, porn, reels etc. These are the demons of modern Mara, distracting us from our own enlightenment. 

And to defeat this modern Mara, we need the skills of the ancient Buddha: **Focus!**
