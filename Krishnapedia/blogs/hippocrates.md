Men suffering from hairloss must have come across DHT by now. 

Hippocrates, the father of medicine, was also curious about hairloss (for obvious reasons, look at the pic ðŸ˜›)

He even applied pigeon droppings on his head. He lost more hair.

He noted that Persian Army Eunuchs guarding kingâ€™s harem didnâ€™t have hairloss. He didnâ€™t exactly know why.

2400 years later, Duke University researchers found that castration lowers testosterone and thus DHT. So thatâ€™s a cure to genetic hairlossðŸ«£
