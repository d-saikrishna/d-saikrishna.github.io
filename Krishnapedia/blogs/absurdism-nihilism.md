I understood Nihilism vs Absurdism this way. 

Imagine you stood at the edge of the cliff. You shouted at the world asking for meaning of life. You won’t hear anything back. Life has no meaning.

You have two options:
1. Be a Nihilist (black cartoon in pic)— crib about the fact that life has no meaning. Withdraw from life.
2. ⁠Be an absurdist (red cartoon)— Enjoy that life has no meaning. Any meaning is burden. You are now free of it.

Be an absurdist 😎
