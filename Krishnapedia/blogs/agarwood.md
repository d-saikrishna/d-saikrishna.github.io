Was reading “Entangled life” by Merlin Sheldrake and found mention of Agarwood (Oudh) trees from India that are used to make perfumes.

Naturally, when these trees get physically injured (ants bore holes), fungi attacks the tree tissue. The tree then releases a resin in defense which accumulates to form Agarwood. Gram to gram, its costlier than gold!

We are now artificially injuring and infecting trees with fungi as seen in the video. Good part of this artificial infection is that only select parts of tree can be infected. So, entire tree need not be harvested.

Basically, perfumes are trees’ immune response to a fungal infection 🌝 Remember that when you spray next 😛
