# A bad experiment by Wikipedia
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="blogs/wikistats.jpg" width="50%"/></div>

Wikipedia once found that having the square corners to their donation box reduced number of donations by 15%, when compared to rounded corners.

Obviously, this is weird. I am unable to find difference between both boxes  easily. But this was a big experiment - 20 lakh people were tested!

It turned out that Wikipedia people messed up the experiment. They sent more square corner boxes at night, when people generally donate less. The negative impact was because of time. Not because of the square corner.

We read lot of 'studies' in newspapers that a chemical cures a disease, another is dangerous etc. Often, similar errors are in those 'studies' as well. Don't believe them so easily.
