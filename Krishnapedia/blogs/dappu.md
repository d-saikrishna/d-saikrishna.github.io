I danced at a friend’s Sangeet and I wrote recollecting all my Sangeet and Baraat dances. One happy fact is how Dappu got accepted by savarna Hindus as well. We see it in Ganesh pandals, weddings etc. 

So Dappu is a percussion instrument famous in Telugu states. It was traditionally made of leather and so became an untouchable art form as Dalits worked with animal skin.

Ofcourse, most Dappus are made of plastic today. They are also not treated on par with other musical instruments.  Cajon boxes are cooler 

In this reel, a dappu player gave a spirited defense to Dappus as an art form on par with ‘classical’ musical instruments. Even if you don’t understand Telugu, wait till the end where he plays ‘classical’ beats on his Dappu.
