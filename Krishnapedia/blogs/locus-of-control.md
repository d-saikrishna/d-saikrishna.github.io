A few ideologies/religions/philosophies teach us to have an external locus of control. Meaning, they teach us to blame external events — Politics, Economics, God, etc., — for our current situation.

There could be some truth in that blame, but it often leaves us with no agency. That we are just victims.

No matter the kind of external situations handed over to us, we should develop an internal locus of control. The belief that we can change our realities. That we are not victims.
