# Indian Ikigai

Can this be considered as Indian Ikigai?

In Telugu (& in other Indian languages) there are two words for a job: ఉద్యోగం (Udyog), పని (kaam)

Early in my career, a mentor suggested that I look for Udyog. The word contains yoga: a mix of Gyana (knowledge), Bhakti (emotion) and Karma (action)

Without Gyana, career becomes just tasks (పని). Not intellectually satisfying.

Without Bhakti, it is like a machine doing a job.

Without Karma, we’d become arm-chair philosophers and crib about the world with all the knowledge we have.
