# Today's case for reservation

Whenever there’s a debate on the reservation policy, the proponents bring upon the historical justification for it — that the communities have been discriminated against and not allowed to access education, social mobility, etc. While historical justification has its place, we should also seek justification for today, to ensure that the policy is serving its purpose.

Let’s take the issue of atrocities against SC/STs and see the relevance of reservation of SC/ST in this context.

To get some perspective, let’s understand a few atrocities that are committed against the SC/STs—
1. Parading an SC/ST member naked or with garlands of footwear. Just last month, an SC man was paraded naked in Madhya Pradesh.
2. Forcing an SC/ST member to eat obnoxious substances. In 2019, two SC persons were forced to eat human excreta in Tamil Nadu.

And many more are detailed in specific in the SC/ST atrocities act. Just reading these [atrocities](https://thewire.in/caste/dark-realities-sc-st-atrocities-act-ethnographic-reading) will give a sense of indignity to which SC/ST are vulnerable.

Now, imagine that a victim of this atrocity musters the courage to complain to the police. If there is a rule of law in the polity, the police will implement the SC/ST atrocities act and ensure that justice is done to the victim. But, the police are not without fear or fervor. They are also from the populace itself and could be motivated by the very feelings that led to the atrocity. [Justice is not done.](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fewer-convictions-in-sc-st-cases-due-to-shoddy-investigations-supreme-court-101635531834261.html)

Thus comes the case of reservation. It comes from the assumption that if the victim can complain to the police, who also belong to the SC/ST community, probably s/he would empathize better with the victim and enforce the law. And if reasonable enforcement happens, it would create a deterrent effect on the perpetrators and the SC/ST members can fear less about atrocities being committed on them.

If the law works on auto-pilot mode, this arrangement is probably not needed. It is our failure to create a rule of law that necessitates reservation.

The same logic applies to make a case for the reservation of women, LGBTQ, and other marginalized sections of society. And the same logic makes me believe that income-based reservation has converted reservation policy into a policy for economic justice, while it is supposed to be a policy for social justice.

**Update**
Are reservations the only way to achieve this representation? Are there no better methods? Certainly not. There will always be scope for improvement. And that should be a matter of debate. Here are a few alternative designs for affirmative action:
1. [Indirect Affirmative Action](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/a-better-design-for-social-justice/): Tarunabh Khaitan suggests that affirmative action be given using more secular criteria instead of identity and group membership criteria. For example, assuming that SCs and STs are major benefeciaries of MGNREGA scheme, he suggests that affirmative action be given to members/families of MGNREGA beneficiary. This way, the intented representation can be achieved and other issues with reservation (rich people getting undue benefits) can also be addressed. It requires a lot of sociological studies on finding the correlations between the group memberships and secular criterion to be targetted.
2. [Inequity Score](https://www.firstpost.com/india/look-beyond-quotas-for-equality-6650451.html):  Pranay Kotasthane and Nitin Pai suggest that every candidate be given an inequity score, calculated based on the diadvantage faced by that candidate. This score will be used along with other scores (exams) in giving out the final rank list. Technically there is no "reservation" or a "quota". People from this rank list will be selected.

Debates on reservation should start here. Any calls to outright remove it because it lacks "merit", just comes from historical amnesia and privilege.
